This solution incorporates Escalent analysis of website data from \\nWork Truck Solutions’ Comvoy.com\\n searchable marketplace for work-ready trucks, which provides insight into commercial vehicle shopper interest.\\n\\n\\nMoving forward, we expect to see the below four key developments emerge in the class 2b-3 commercial vehicle space between now and 2032:\\n\\n\\n#1. E-commerce Delivery Tops Growth Prospects\\n\\n\\nDelivery is expected to be the fastest growing use case through the end of the decade, while body types such as service trucks, service utility van, box van, flatbed, crew van and passenger van will sustain growth. In addition, demand for chassis cabs, cutaways, cargo vans and passenger vans is expected to grow rapidly in the short term and then slow in the medium- to long-term, while demand for pickups will fall slightly through the end of the decade.\\n\\n\\nGrowth Outlook for Key Deployment Industries of Class 2b-3 Commercial Vehicles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndustry\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse Cases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrowth Prospect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nE-commerce\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDelivery\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPer \\neMarketer\\n, the US e-commerce industry is expected to reach 1.7 trillion USD by 2027\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConstruction trades\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEquipment transport, material handling, mobility, services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMedium\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the \\nFMI\\n, US construction spending is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 3.9% from 2022 to 2027\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral service\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEquipment transport, maintenance and repair, mobility\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the \\nBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\\n, installation, maintenance and repair occupations are expected to have 228,000 more employees over the next decade\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgriculture and farm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaintenance and repair, material handling, mobility, heavy hauling/trailering\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the \\nOECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2023-32\\n, North America’s agriculture and farming output is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.4% from 2022 to 2032\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#2. Relaxed EPA Regulations Will Provide Flexibility for OEMs to Meet Emissions Requirements\\n\\n\\nWhile zero emissions is still the goal, \\nnew EPA guidelines\\n published in March 2024 enable manufacturers to choose between advanced internal combustion engine (ICE) and zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) technologies to lower emissions, enabling the industry to take a more gradual approach to reducing emissions and presenting big opportunities for hybrid vehicles. Applicable to vehicles for model years (MY) 2027–2032, the new standards are expected to result in a 44% reduction in projected fleet average emissions in 2032 compared with 2026.\\n\\n\\nDespite the push for zero emissions, gasoline and diesel engines will still be around in 2030, with gasoline engines increasing due to favorable cost base and the ability to meet emissions requirements more easily than diesel. Hybrids will emerge as a viable alternative to electrification, and the extension of carbon credits programs for hybrids beyond 2027 will make them more attractive to manufacturers and vehicle buyers.\\n\\n\\nThe approach to meeting emission standards—whether through hybridization or electrification—will also be strongly determined by use cases, use patterns, available infrastructure and adoption rates. For instance, passenger vans, box vans and crew vans lend themselves better to electric powertrains due to local use patterns and controlled environments. These vehicles run mostly on predetermined routes and return to base at the end of the day, reducing the risk of critically low battery levels and ensuring optimum battery recharging at depots overnight. Therefore, we expect higher electrification levels in the van segment for last-mile, localized delivery use cases. In fact, this segment presents the best opportunity for electrification out of all class 2b-3 segments.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, service trucks, service utility vans and flatbeds are better suited to hybridization as their operating conditions and technical requirements are varied. These use cases often require higher payload, towing and power takeoff capabilities, which are currently better suited for ICE and hybrid vehicles. This is why we expect to see more hybridization in chassis cabs and pickups.\\n\\n\\n#3. Customers Will Demand Commercial Vehicles Built for Productivity and Ease of Use\\n\\n\\nUpfitting will take center stage as customers look for vehicles they can use as mobile workspaces where everything is within reach. Body manufacturers will work to make vehicles such as vans, utility and service vehicles as operationally efficient and practical as possible with innovative racks and shelving to hold tooling, and expandable work surfaces for workshop environment designs.\\n\\n\\nThis will benefit users such as HVAC contractors, electrical contractors and home contractors who require a mobile workstation that can help them improve efficiencies and gain capabilities such as fabricating parts onsite.\\n\\n\\n#4. Connected Services Will Become an Important Requirement in Commercial Vehicles\\n\\n\\nAs commercial fleets seek more efficiency in their route planning and driving patterns, internet-enabled connected vehicle services can enable a better connection with their vehicles and drivers, providing valuable insights into routes and driver behavior. Therefore, these technologies will become an important value driver in the coming years. More OEMs will focus on developing connected vehicle services as part of their fleet offerings to meet this demand and generate new revenue streams in the process. For example, Ford Pro offers connected solutions that communicate operating data to customers, including alerts for charging an electric vehicle, route plans to avoid EVs running out of range, gas or diesel powertrain alerts, as well as fuel economy and maintenance alerts. Stellantis has also recently announced a similar suite of services under its Ram Professional solution.\\n\\n\\nOther connected vehicle services customers are asking for include the ability to download invoices and take credit cards onsite to quickly complete transactions anywhere. These connected services not only provide visibility into the use cycle of the vehicle, but also save costs and increase efficiencies.\\n\\n\\nRecommendations for Class 2b-3 Commercial Vehicle OEMs, Body Companies and Suppliers to Stay Competitive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderstand vehicle use cases and customer needs:\\n Familiarize yourself with how vehicles are being used and upfit in the field and what attributes businesses are looking for so you can ensure you provide products and services that fulfill customer needs.\\n\\n\\nGet to know the competitive landscape:\\n Identify trends—including \\nhow competitors spec and configure vehicles\\n—so you can take strategic action to meet the changing demands. Entrants can compete by entering the market with electric vehicles and possibly partnering with body companies to break into niche segments.\\n\\n\\nTune into the customer journey:\\n Get a better understanding of \\nhow buyers shop\\n, including vehicle interest, consideration, inventory and sales trends.\\n\\n\\nBe aware of changing EPA regulations:\\n Be sure to keep track of and \\nstay up-to-date on the latest industry news\\n and developments to ensure compliance when developing new products and services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet in touch using the below form to learn more about how our \\ncommercial vehicle and fleet experts\\n can help you gain a comprehensive view of current and future commercial vehicle supply, demand, inventory and sales data for more accurate and effective product and strategic planning.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more?

Sounds good but what does it really mean and why should anyone care? After all, if a brand’s product or service seems reasonable, does it really matter if the brand is perceived as “authentic?”\\n\\n\\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines authentic as being “true to one’s own personality, spirit, or character” and “conforming to or based on fact.” Looking at brands through this lens, it becomes more obvious why brand authenticity is important. When a brand promotes itself in an inauthentic, contrived way that is disconnected from reality, the overall credibility of the brand takes a hit. If consumers feel a brand is misrepresenting itself and what it stands for, it becomes difficult for those consumers to believe any of the brand’s claims, especially about its offerings. In contrast, when a brand presents itself in a way that is honest, transparent, and consistent with how it operates, consumers develop faith in the brand.\\n\\n\\nThe Connection Between Brand Authenticity and Brand Trust\\n\\n\\nBrand authenticity is important because it directly feeds into something that is even more important: \\nbrand trust and loyalty\\n. When a brand establishes a strong degree of trust between itself and its customers, the brand benefits from a more positive perception of its organization, goods, and services. In turn, this trust means that the brand’s customer base is much more likely to do repeat business because the brand has given them good reason to stay loyal. The value of this trust is so significant that many customers are willing to pay more to work with a trusted brand rather than take the risk of working with an unvetted firm.\\n\\n\\nPatagonia: A Brand Authenticity Success Story\\n\\n\\nPatagonia is a great example of how brand authenticity has earned brand trust and brand loyalty. Founded in 1973 by outdoorsman Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia has established itself as a leading retailer of premium, outdoor clothing and equipment. From the beginning, Patagonia positioned itself as a firm making products by and for those individuals who know and love the outdoors. An emphasis is placed on providing products of the highest quality to stand up to the rigors of nature. Products are guaranteed and backed by a liberal return policy that ensures customer satisfaction.\\n\\n\\nEqually important, Patagonia has established itself as a brand that cares about environmentalism. Recognizing today’s environmental challenges such as climate change, polluted waters and expanding landfills, Patagonia has made environmental activism an integral part of its company mission. It introduced a repair operation for its clothing so that customers could maximize the life of their products rather than throw them away prematurely. Patagonia also utilizes recycled materials to manufacture its clothing line, and its cotton products are all grown organically.\\n\\n\\nBut perhaps most significant, Chouinard made the decision in 2022 to turn the privately held company over to joint ownership by a trust and an environmental non-profit organization. Under this arrangement, the trust will ensure Patagonia will continue to operate its business under a consistent set of core values. In turn, profits not needed for business operations will be transferred to the non-profit organization.\\n\\n\\nAs a result, Patagonia’s products and services are in alignment with its core values and operations: dedication to its customers, an outdoor lifestyle, and the environment at large. The result is a loyal customer base that considers the Patagonia brand to be both authentic and trustworthy. Patagonia doesn’t just “talk the talk,” it “walks the walk.”\\n\\n\\nCostco: A Brand Authenticity Success Story\\n\\n\\nFor many of us, Costco is not just a beloved brand, but a place we visit on a regular basis to fill our pantries, equip our living rooms, and fill our gas tanks, all while finding deals that make our hearts sing. Originally formed as Price Club in 1976, this titan of warehouse clubs has grown over the years to include 800 locations across the globe. Since its inception, Costco has focused on providing high-quality products at high-value prices. Costco famously demands the best pricing from its suppliers and then proceeds to sell its products with minimal mark up, much lower than traditional retailers. While much of its revenue comes from membership fees, its business model relies primarily on selling in volume.\\n\\n\\nCostco recognizes that to drive this volume, it needs to offer deals that excite value shoppers. In addition to an ever-changing set of featured specials, Costco has drawn customers for years with two food mainstays: rotisserie chicken that it sells for $5 and a hot dog and soda that it sells for $1.50. As you can imagine, keeping prices at these levels puts enormous pressure on the bottom line, yet Costco has refused to buckle to this pressure.\\n\\n\\nAs recounted in \\n425 Business\\n, one executive came to the CEO at the time and said,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n“‘Jim, we can’t sell this hot dog for a buck fifty. We are losing our rear ends.’ \\nAnd he said\\n, ‘If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.’ That’s all I really needed. By the way, if you raised (the price) to $1.75, it would not be that big of a deal. People would still buy (it). But it’s the mindset that when you think of Costco, you think of the $1.50 hot dog (and soda).’”\\n\\n\\nThrough the years, Wall Street has questioned why Costco has kept its margins so low and compensated its employees more than many of its competitors. The argument went that higher prices and lower expenses would mean greater profits and higher stock prices. Yet, Costco has firmly remained true to its founding ideals of delighting customers by offering a low price, high-value shopping experience\\n.\\n The result of remaining true to itself? A devoted customer base that loves shopping for deals, solid revenue increases year over year, and a stock price that has climbed over 60% in just the past year.\\n\\n\\nThree Lessons Learned from Authentic, Trusted Brands\\n\\n\\nWhat Patagonia and Costco teach us is that there are several elements common to the most authentic, trusted brands. While not an exhaustive list, the following are some of the most important:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrand and products are aligned:\\n Products and services are consistent with the brand’s mission, core values and key attributes\\n\\n\\nProducts perform as promised: \\nCustomers know that the products will live up to their promise by being dependable and of high quality\\n\\n\\nBrand is customer oriented: \\nThe brand is committed to supporting its customers in the best ways possible and will make things right for them should they encounter any problems or difficulties\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course, establishing brand trust is easier said than done. Focus, introspection and concerted effort are keys to fully understanding what the brand is today and what it aspires to be. There is also a need to determine whether customers share this brand understanding and find the brand’s offerings to be compatible with its positioning. When there are discrepancies between a brand’s ideal and actual state, additional work must be done to determine how to bridge this gap.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about fostering customer trust through authenticity, download \\nBrand Authenticity: What It Means, Why It Matters and How to Get There\\n.'}\n","{'Index': 3, 'Heading': 'Class 2b-3 Commercial Vehicles: Where We Are and Where We’re Going', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/class-2b-3-commercial-vehicles-where-we-are-and-where-were-going/', 'Content': 'Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), body manufacturers, suppliers and users of class 2b-3 commercial vehicles are facing rising complexities to meet changing industry demands while also complying with tightening emissions requirements. Navigating these challenges requires an understanding of customer requirements based on many possible use cases.\\n\\n\\nIt’s a complicated web that manufacturers such as the Big 3—Ford, GM and Stellantis/Ram—body manufacturers and suppliers must plot a course through.

These types play important roles in various industries, each serving specific functions and providing unique benefits:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCab chassis\\n are preferred for reliability and ease of upfit in industries such as construction, services, drilling and boring, agriculture, landscaping, and material handling and sales.\\n\\n\\nPickup trucks\\n are popular for their versatility in construction, landscaping, services, and agriculture.\\n\\n\\nCargo vans\\n are commonly used in construction trades, transport services, material delivery, and sales and services. With a wide range of lengths and heights, cargo vans provide indispensable transport services, facilitating the movement of goods, services and passengers.\\n\\n\\nCutaway chassis\\n vehicles are commonly used in construction, agriculture, transport services, material handling and sales, and passenger transport industries.\\n\\n\\nPassenger vans\\n are crucial for mobility and passenger transport needs, especially for shuttle buses and private hire operations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the following chart, you can see the share of prospects versus sales for each of these chassis types.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCab chassis and cutaways have a much higher share in prospects compared with sales due to requirements for specific body types and longer lead times, while pickups are the top-selling chassis due to easier availability right off the dealer’s lot. Because cargo vans have a range of body styles, they can often be sold as received from the OEM, although some require modifications to fit their intended use. As such, the share of prospects and sales for this type are closely aligned.\\n\\n\\nOEMs Leading the Commercial Vehicle Class 2b-3 Market\\n\\n\\nAs the leading commercial vehicle manufacturer, Ford leads the van and cutaway segments, and along with GM (including BrightDrop) and Stellantis/Ram, these Big 3 brands have a strong hold over the segment with presence across multiple product categories.\\n\\n\\nIsuzu, with its chassis cab, and Mercedes Benz, with its Sprinter van models, are the only other traditional manufacturers participating in the segment. Start-ups, including Mullen, Rivian and Vicinity Motors, have recently entered or have plans to enter the class 2b-3 market, while Nissan has announced it will discontinue its Titan series and exit the segment.\\n\\n\\nService truck bodies are the predominant body type of interest for customers shopping the Big 3 OEMs, followed by service utility vans and flatbed trucks. This is directly proportional to the popularity of cab chassis and cutaways in the prospects for this segment.\\n\\n\\nFinally, specialized upfitted vehicles emerge as top requirements from potential buyers.\\n\\n\\nOEMs’ Product Portfolio of Class 2b-3 Commercial Vehicles by Chassis Type\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOEM\\n\\n\\nPickup\\n\\n\\nCargo Van\\n\\n\\nChassis Cab\\n\\n\\nCutaway\\n\\n\\nPassenger Wagon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFord\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGM (including BrightDrop)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIsuzu\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMercedes-Benz\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMullen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNissan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRivian\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStellantis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVicinity Motors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: 2024 Escalent Commercial Vehicle Competitive Landscape—Powertrain Build Plan\\n\\n\\nWhat’s Next for Class 2b-3 Commercial Vehicles\\n\\n\\nNow that you’re up-to-date on the current state of the class 2b-3 commercial vehicles market, don’t miss Part 2 of this blog series, coming out soon, to find out more about where the market is heading.

In Italy and Spain, consumers are seen as next in line to take responsibility, but in the UK, Germany and France, there is a sense that both corporates and consumers should step up together to improve the situation.\\n\\n\\nSo, what does the consumer/corporate choreography need to look like if everyone is to walk happily along the path toward environmental sustainability?\\n\\n\\nEuropean New-Car Buyer Opinion on Automotive Sustainability\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s \\nEVForward® Europe study\\n—conducted each year among 10,000 new-car buyers in the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain to understand the future of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in Europe—shows that automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) need to navigate astutely on their journey toward sustainability.\\n\\n\\nAccording to our findings, many of Europe’s new-car buyers are far happier dispensing their sustainability responsibilities in the home and in the supermarket rather than in factors that impact their direct experience with a new car.\\n\\n\\n70% of Europe’s new-car buyers are not yet ready for recyclable materials in visible areas of their new car.\\n\\n\\nMore than twice as many new-car buyers are happy to reduce food waste and energy and water consumption at home as those who are ready to look for recyclable materials in visible areas of the car.\\n\\n\\nDifferent Sustainability Attitudes Among European Consumers\\n\\n\\nAlthough most of Europe’s new-car buyers aren’t considering environmental sustainability when shopping for their next vehicle, we did find that knowing the OEM is being more sustainable increases purchase consideration among 55% of European consumers.\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to buying a new car, many new-car buyers are happy to abdicate responsibility for sustainable production to OEMs with the expectation that OEMs will do everything they can to be sustainable “behind the factory gates” rather than “up close and personal” in consumers’ precious new car. Only about one-third of new-car buyers would consider the amount of carbon released during production and/or the use of recycled materials in less visible areas of the vehicle when shopping for a car. Not surprisingly, EV Owners and EV Intenders—the latter being consumers who are more than 15 times more likely to purchase a BEV than the average new-car buyer—are more likely to take sustainability factors into consideration when shopping for their next vehicle.\\n\\n\\nThere are significant nuances across countries and vehicle brands owned:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew-car buyers in Italy and Spain claim to be more influenced by sustainability principles on a daily basis than their northern European counterparts.\\n\\n\\nSome, but not all, premium vehicle brand owners claim to be more influenced by sustainability principles but how they want to experience sustainability varies to a great degree.\\n\\n\\nOverall, mainstream vehicle brand owners tend to be less inclined toward sustainability, but high and low points do not always appear where they might be expected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAutomotive OEMs need to understand the speed and direction in which their customers want to walk toward sustainability—and reconcile this with imperatives imposed on them by legislators. While those imperatives give OEMs relatively little space to maneuver, the ability to recognize what would be acceptable to new-car buyers in Europe will minimize the risk of a disconnect between brand promises and customer expectations.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to learn more about European new-car buyer attitudes and our EVForward Europe findings, please send us a note by filling out the form below.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more?

Teslas and other EVs have become a common sight on the road, as have charging stations in parking lots. Even in rural towns it is common to see EV charging stations. These findings aren’t purely anecdotal, as according to our \\nEVForward® research on the next generation of EV buyers\\n, among the new-car buyer population in the US, 3% now own an EV and 25% intend to buy one in the near future. With several US states offering consumers substantial financial incentives to buy a new electric vehicle, these numbers are expected to rise.\\n\\n\\nAddressing the Barrier of EV Charging\\n\\n\\nOne of the biggest barriers to EV adoption has been lack of access to and the unavailability of safe, fast-charging stations where and when drivers need them. Much has been discussed in the industry about how to more quickly build out the infrastructure to serve the growing need for EV charging stations, which is high in consumers’ minds when thinking about EVs.\\n\\n\\nWhile access to public charging has been a major barrier to EV adoption in the past, this barrier is declining. New findings from our EVForward 2024 US EV Market Profile study reveal that only 25% of new-car buyers cited lack of access to public EV charging as a barrier. The \\ntechnology industry\\n has played an important role in alleviating these concerns, mainly through navigation and charging location and type apps. Now, these companies can turn to continually improving the public EV charging experience for consumers while also capitalizing on the growing EV market.\\n\\n\\nAs more EV drivers enter the roadways, we wanted to better understand their EV charging habits, expectations and desires when driving locally and taking road trips so we could pinpoint how technology companies can best serve the EV market. To do this, we interviewed a US online sample of 1,000 EV owners and EV Intenders.\\n\\n\\nConsumer Preferences on Navigation and EV Charging Methods\\n\\n\\nWhen taking road trips with an EV, we found online search (57%), general navigation services (45%) and in-car navigation services (29%) are overwhelmingly the top preferred methods for locating a charging station in the US for EV Intenders and EV owners. This highlights the importance of services such as Google Maps, Apple Maps and Waze to display information that is meaningful—such as fast charger availability at each charging station—to EV drivers when they are trying to locate a charging station.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEV Charging Speeds, Reliability, Safety and Cost\\n\\n\\nBeyond location, the top five factors that impact charging station selection while on road trips include charging speed (51%), location being close to travel route (48%), safety (47%), cost (46%) and charging reliability (43%). Consumers are likely to favor apps that supply this information; while this information is included in some apps, it is often incomplete. For example, some fast-charging stations do not integrate with Google Maps to display charger availability, whereas the availability of a charger and not having to wait is a strong consideration factor (39%) for EV drivers when choosing a charging station.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMoreover, we found that during road trips, if all EV charging station plugs are occupied at a charging station, more than half of EV drivers would either drive to an alternate station with available plugs (25%) or research where the next nearest charging station is and hope it has available plugs (28%). This underscores the need to include EV charger availability information within charging or navigation apps so consumers know where to charge most efficiently when they require it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKeeping all EV charger information up to date is important as it allows EV drivers to more effectively plan their charging stops and eliminate unwanted surprises. Further, consumers will be attracted to apps that get this right as it is so important to the driving, traveling and public charging experience. With cost also being a top consideration, charging and navigation apps can play a key role in providing alerts to possible charging station fines (staying plugged in after charging is complete), which would help EV drivers assess the cost-risk associated with various EV charging stations.\\n\\n\\nThe Intersection of EV Charging, Technology and Retail\\n\\n\\nIn our \\nprevious post\\n, we talked about how retailers, convenience stores and quick-service restaurants can invest in EV charging infrastructure so EV drivers can stop, charge their vehicle and simultaneously fulfill other needs at these locations, thereby adding a new revenue stream for these businesses.\\n\\n\\nAccording to our findings, nearly half (47%) of drivers indicate they would be more likely to choose a store or restaurant to charge at if they received a discount on purchases. Also, 44% said they would be more likely to choose a store or restaurant if they could use their reward points to pay for charging their EV.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis opens the door for charging app and navigation companies to create new revenue streams by partnering with retailers and destinations (such as state parks or tourist attractions) to promote their EV charging stations and offerings. The apps could even deliver targeted ads with discounts and rewards to these locations. In this way, the apps can serve as advertising channels to entice consumers to take a break from driving and grab a bite to eat, shop at their favorite retailer, or take in entertainment while they charge their EV.\\n\\n\\nImagine a family on a road trip with kids who need to use the restroom and parents who need to charge their EV. When looking for the nearest EV charging station, the navigation app the parents are using could offer a 10% discount to a quick-serve restaurant with an available charger on their route. At one convenient location, the family can charge their EV, use the facilities and enjoy a discount while fueling up the family with a snack or meal. This is a win-win-win scenario for app companies, retailers and consumers, as EV drivers can take advantage of discounts and rewards while enjoying their favorite foods and beverages or shopping and entertainment activities as their EV charges.\\n\\n\\nFinally, as drivers charge their EVs, there are opportunities for app providers to build in features to collect user feedback on charging locations, allow users to make dining or entertainment-related reservations, and easily process payments for charging or link to other apps to order and pay for goods and services.\\n\\n\\nAs the automobile becomes the next great frontier for advertisers, companies such as \\n4Screen\\n say they will “give a voice to businesses by providing engaging in-car communications.” Navigation and charging app companies can capitalize on these advertising dollars, too, by serving up ads on their platforms.\\n\\n\\nEV Charging Education, Reservations, Payments and Rewards\\n\\n\\nNow that there is \\none EV charging station for every 15 gas stations,\\n apps that facilitate finding EV charger locations and provide updated charger information are becoming table stakes. As such, EV charging and navigation app providers have a golden opportunity to expand app features and deliver new services that make owning and driving an EV seamless and worry-free for drivers—which, in turn, would create a sticky app experience for users and build brand loyalty.\\n\\n\\nThe key lies in expanding functionality through the following:\\n\\n\\nEV charger locator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFind nearby EV charging stations\\n\\n\\nShow station types (Level 1, Level 2, Fast Chargers)\\n\\n\\nProvide directions to nearby EV charging stations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEV charger information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProvide live updates on charger availability\\n\\n\\nShare community reviews of EV charging stations\\n\\n\\nCollect user feedback on cleanliness, safety, overall experience, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEV education\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOptimize charging schedules based on electricity rates, grid demand and user preferences\\n\\n\\nEducate users about different charging speeds, connector types and best practices\\n\\n\\nProvide troubleshooting guides to assist users in case of issues during charging\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEV charger reservations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow users to reserve EV charging spots in advance, reducing wait times\\n\\n\\nServe up discounts on lodging along the route and allow an interface for reserving a room\\n\\n\\nServe up rewards or discounts off attractions coming up along the route\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPayments and rewards\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntegrate payment systems to simplify transactions, making it seamless for users to pay for EV charging sessions\\n\\n\\nProvide points, discounts, and/or rewards for using specific EV charging stations\\n\\n\\nInclude gamification features to encourage users to charge at specific locations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreating a More Holistic EV Ecosystem\\n\\n\\nAs the EV market grows and matures, tech companies can contribute significantly to the growth of EV adoption by simplifying public EV charging processes, enhancing user convenience and experience, and fostering a supportive EV community via helpful, popular apps.\\n\\n\\nTech companies will need to collaborate with automakers, retailers, utilities and governments to create a more holistic EV ecosystem that serves consumers, businesses and advertisers alike. As the apps evolve, they can help consumers better understand new types of EV charging as the infrastructure is further developed, and how EV drivers can better plan road trips and family vacations. App providers can also partner with automakers, energy companies and governments so that the full suite of EV chargers are available to drivers, independent of vehicle type. Finally, as more people adopt EVs, app providers, retailers, attractions and entertainment companies can combine forces to make road trips with an EV enjoyable for the entire family.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about the findings from our study on How the EV Revolution Will Upend the Energy, Retail and Technology Landscapes and how you can position your business for success, join us for a webinar on May 21 at 1pm EDT.

These participants included EV owners, EV Intenders and individuals who were considering purchasing an EV. The age range of respondents spanned 18 to 80 years. The recruitment process involved selecting participants from the\\xa0PureSpectrum\\xa0opt-in online panel of US adults, and the interviews were conducted online.

The pressure and risks associated with developing groundbreaking products and services can be enormous and overwhelming. But innovations don’t have to be created from scratch or in a vacuum. Current products and services may meet basic customer needs, but sometimes they don’t fully address higher-level customer objectives (or “jobs to be done”). If firms can identify these broader objectives and “break the mold” with new and reimagined products and services, these innovations can sometimes be so successful that they transform their respective industries.\\n\\n\\nThe proof?\\n\\n\\nSeveral years ago, I was in the field interviewing respondents on a wide range of topics. At one point during the interviews, I asked a question about the respondent’s interest in electric vehicles. The most common response was something along the lines of, “No, I am not really that interested in EVs. But a Tesla—I could really get interested in a Tesla!”\\n\\n\\nAfter further discussion, it became clear that respondents equated EVs with small, plain, compact cars (think Nissan Leaf or Honda Fit), whereas they thought of Tesla as something different and “cool.” It was an interesting example of how firms can introduce game-changing products by breaking the mold in new and different ways.\\n\\n\\nOther manufacturers thought that the key to EV success was designing compact vehicles with maximum efficiency as the goal. But Tesla understood that style was still one of the most important considerations in car shoppers’ minds. Tesla’s innovation was that it not only developed advanced EV technology, but also packaged it in a beautiful, stylish vehicle that didn’t look like a typical EV. \\nTesla broke the mold of its vehicle category by taking a page from the old (i.e., developing an appealing, stylish design) and making it new (i.e., by wrapping this design around its innovative EV technology).\\n\\n\\nGiven how integrated Zoom is in our business lives today, it may be hard to believe that Zoom is a little over 10 years old. Prior to Zoom’s popularity, businesspeople tended to rely on voice conferencing or in-person meetings to communicate with colleagues and clients. Voice conferencing is convenient and inexpensive but doesn’t provide the intimacy and nuance of communicating in-person (e.g., how participants look, feel and react) or the ability to review documents. While meeting in-person resolves these problems, it also means that individuals must take the time, effort and expense to get themselves to a common space, whether that is by commuting to a company office or flying across country to meet with a client.\\n\\n\\nWith the introduction of Zoom, users were able to benefit from a system that was as easy to use as audio conferencing but also provided greater personal connection and work productivity through video communication and features like document sharing. This became obvious when the pandemic hit and individuals and businesses were suddenly forced to continue operations while working primarily from home. Using Zoom, businesses realized that they didn’t always need to invest the time and expense of meeting clients in person. In turn, employees realized that they enjoyed working from home and eliminating their commute, while firms discovered they didn’t require as much office space when employees were only occasionally coming into the office. \\nIn summary, Zoom’s success was not just because it developed a better communication tool but also because it dramatically changed business operations.\\n\\n\\nWhile Uber is now a major transportation player, it is also still a young firm that has only been in business for 15 years. At the time that Uber launched, it wasn’t obvious there was a need for an additional “cars for hire” service. Taxi and limousine services had existed for years and Uber wasn’t offering anything radically different in terms of basic transportation (i.e., it was still designed to get individuals from point A to point B).\\n\\n\\nBut Uber broke the mold of transportation services in different ways. Because of various governmental controls and constraints, the country’s taxi and limousine companies have typically been regionally organized and operated. In contrast, after establishing a network of contract drivers throughout the country, Uber has become a transportation company with a national footprint. Uber’s mobile app also enables customers to quickly and easily request rides on-demand, regardless of where they are located. As a result, customers no longer have to go searching for a taxi but can rely on Uber drivers to find them instead. Because the mobile app and national network of contracted drivers are integrated, customers can use the same app in the same way regardless of what city or region they happen to be in.\\n\\n\\nAll of this means that Uber has become much more than just “another taxi service”. \\nBy rethinking what customers want from transportation services, Uber has changed the transportation paradigm from a local/regional model to a national, on-demand model.\\n\\n\\nThese three business examples are proof that tomorrow’s innovations can begin with looking at today’s established products and services in a new light. By taking a step back and determining whether the current offerings are really optimized to achieve all customers’ objectives or “jobs to be done,” firms can identify new ways to innovate. \\nThe opportunity for innovation comes when firms can widen their lens and determine whether there is a larger problem or opportunity that is not currently being addressed by today’s products and services.\\n\\n\\nEscalent is prepared to help you explore these kinds of innovation opportunities, whether it’s through secondary research to understand market trends, primary research to understand your customers’ needs or “jobs to be done,” or data analytics to assist in identifying winning concepts and feature sets. Working in partnership with your firm, Escalent stands ready to provide you with the insights and direction you need to “break the mold” and establish new innovations within your industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more?

In 2023, \\n14.6%\\n of new-car sales in the European Union (EU) were BEVs, according to ACEA. This figure represents the highest percentage of BEV sales among all continents, showcasing Europe’s lead in sustainable mobility despite a recent stagnation in BEV sales due, in part, to the ongoing war in Ukraine and its economic impact along with slower than anticipated BEV charging infrastructure development, which is likely to be temporary. This growth is driven by several factors, including government regulations mandating the transition to BEVs, continual improvement in battery technology offering greater BEV range and lower costs, and growing awareness and acceptance of BEVs among consumers.\\n\\n\\nWhile the impact of BEV adoption on traditional sectors such as \\nautomotive\\n, \\nenergy\\n, oil and gas, and manufacturing is evident, retail is another crucial aspect of life that will be affected. Modern retailers heavily reliant on the sale of fuel, such as Tesco, Carrefour and E.Leclerc, risk facing increased challenges in drawing shoppers to their stores. However, while the decline in fuel sales will be inevitable with the rise of BEVs, this presents a unique opportunity for these retailers to compensate for the decline in fuel sales and create new revenue streams by strategically investing in BEV charging stations. Better still, retailers can provide solutions to one of the top pain points BEV drivers have: charging time.\\n\\n\\nAddressing the Consumer Pain Point of BEV Charging\\n\\n\\nFor drivers, charging their BEV requires them to spend more time at or around a location. This presents an attractive opening for forward-thinking retailers to offer a broader range of services. Brands such as \\nIkea\\n and \\nTesco\\n are already leading the way, recognizing the value of incorporating BEV charging into their retail sites.\\n\\n\\nHowever, key questions remain:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill customers prioritize retailers with BEV charging stations?\\n\\n\\nWhat will be the deciding factors for consumers when choosing where to stop?\\n\\n\\nWhich retailers, quick-service restaurants (QSRs) and convenience stores do BEV drivers frequent? And what would cause them to frequent one location over others?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe answers are crucial for retailers as they consider substantial investments required to build BEV charging infrastructure at their locations. This is why Escalent recently partnered with \\nPureSpectrum\\n to survey BEV drivers and intenders in Germany, France and the UK to understand how the e-mobility transition is shifting and will continue to shift consumer spending and how retail brands can win during this shift.\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding the Diverse Charging Needs of BEV Drivers\\n\\n\\nThe charging needs of BEV drivers are not one-size-fits-all. They vary based on the length and the type of journey, familiarity with the terrain, and even the passengers involved. We determined three distinct scenarios that illustrate how BEV charging needs and behaviors differ and how retailers can align with each to benefit.\\n\\n\\n1. The Unfamiliar Adventure for BEV Drivers\\n\\n\\nThis mode is triggered when travelers take road trips outside their local areas, typically requiring travelers to be on the road for at least two hours. Close to seven in ten people surveyed report taking such journeys in the past six months, making an average of more than three stops, with two-thirds lasting up to 30 minutes on a trip of around 650 km, lasting approximately 7.5 hours. Long journeys to unfamiliar places in BEVs often require more planning on where to charge than on where to get gas in petrol or diesel vehicles and this presents a significant opportunity to capture a share of consumer spending.\\n\\n\\nTravelers report making stops for various purposes during their road trips; restroom breaks, comfort stops, refueling, recharging and quick meals at fast-food restaurants are among the most common stops reported. These stops are often spontaneous, except for BEV recharging, which is often planned. Range anxiety for BEV drivers necessitates meticulous planning on where and when to stop for a charge. Factoring in their vehicle’s range, BEV drivers carefully plot their route just as they would map out destinations on a tour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor traditional stops at QSRs or convenience stores, travelers rely on web searches, general navigation, and automaker-owned, in-car navigation apps. However, BEV charging changes the equation. Charging location apps (such as PlugShare and Chargeway) and charging station brand apps (such as BP Pulse and Ionity) become crucial tools in the search for BEV charging points. Retailers hoping to attract these road-tripping BEV customers should prioritize building visibility in these charging location apps and establishing partnerships with BEV charging networks. Furthermore, marketing, advertising and providing incentives through these apps for charging and shopping at the retailer’s locations as well as offering enhanced convenience by integrating charging point booking through the charging network app can build awareness of the charging stations that the retailer offers and thereby gain entry into BEV drivers’ charging ecosystem consideration set.\\n\\n\\nDecisions on the choice to stop at QSRs, convenience stores or retailers is generally made jointly between the driver and passenger(s). However, when it comes to BEV charging, we found that 45% of drivers make the decision independently whereas joint decision-making between the driver and passenger(s) takes place in 49% of cases.\\n\\n\\nOn a road trip, McDonald’s is the most frequented fast-food restaurant (60%), with others such as Burger King (25%), KFC (13%) and Starbucks (12%) being far behind. Retailers such as Lidl (15%), Tesco (14%) and E. Leclerc (13%) are most visited during road trips. 7-Eleven (23%) is the most visited convenience store, followed by Carrefour City/Express/Montagne (9%).\\n\\n\\nTravelers mention charging speed, cost, location close to the journey route, and charging reliability as the top reasons for choosing a charging location on a BEV road trip. Retailers that prioritize and communicate these factors effectively stand to gain a significant advantage in attracting this lucrative segment of customers.\\n\\n\\nShell, Total, Esso, Aral and BP capture the majority of refueling stops. With the exception of Esso, these brands are aggressively expanding their BEV charging networks across Europe to maintain their market share and remain relevant in the era of BEVs. Shell, with its charging arm, Shell Recharge (25%), and BP, with its BP Pulse (13%), are among the top brands travelers report having charged at during their road trips. The rest, especially Esso, need to enhance their BEV charging infrastructure to remain competitive.\\n\\n\\n2. The Familiar Routine for BEV Drivers\\n\\n\\nThis consists of shorter trips within familiar territory that are a regular part of a BEV driver’s routine. Charging behaviors during shorter, routine trips in familiar surroundings differ substantially from long road trip adventures in unfamiliar territory. Home charging is the primary method, accounting for more than half of all charging needs, while workplaces and schools contribute roughly 15%. However, public BEV charging stations still play a vital role, accounting for over one-quarter of all charging needs during these familiar travel routines.\\n\\n\\nSo, where do travelers prefer to plug in during their local travels? Shopping malls (42%) emerge as highly coveted charging destinations. This preference stems from their convenience—easy access, ample parking spaces and a higher chance of finding a free charger due to the sheer number of charging points. Car parks (33%) and on-street parking (28%) are popular for similar reasons.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis trend presents an attractive opportunity for retailers, especially those within shopping malls, to install BEV charging stations and attract customers. Retailers can drive more business by offering discounts or incentives to customers who use their charging stations and shop at their stores. This approach is likely to be effective because BEV drivers indicate that such offers would make them prefer one retailer over others. Furthermore, 75% of BEV drivers are actively seeking ways to occupy most of their time while their vehicle charges. Currently, BEV drivers are using this time to walk around, purchase and eat food, nap, shop, remain in the car, play games or otherwise entertain themselves. This is the prime occasion for retailers to capture additional consumer spending.\\n\\n\\nRetailers can also use the type of charger as a differentiator, as charging speed is a top priority for customers. A high proportion (58%) of BEV drivers prefer retailers with Level 2 chargers, while an even more impressive 69% report a preference for retailers that offer direct-current fast charging (DCFC).\\n\\n\\n3. The Unexpected Boost for BEV Drivers\\n\\n\\nNot every charging session is planned. The unexpected boost mode is akin to seizing an opportunity—using a BEV charger when drivers unexpectedly notice an available charging point. When presented with such an opening, drivers charge their BEV simply because a charging point is available at their current location rather than out of necessity.\\n\\n\\nNearly seven in ten (69%) drivers report opportunistically using a free BEV charging spot even when their battery does not need a charge. This behavior presents another opening for retailers to drive incremental business, as more than half of these opportunistic drivers (55%) would be willing to extend their stay in-store while their vehicle charges. This unexpected time allows retailers to engage these consumers for longer.\\n\\n\\nIt is evident that brands with louder footfalls stand to benefit more from this opportunity if they can align their charging offerings effectively. Therefore, the impact of this opportunity is likely to be greater for brands that are currently more frequented by customers, such as fast-food chains like McDonald’s, Burger King, KFC, Subway and Starbucks, as well as retail stores such as Lidl, Tesco, Ikea, REWE and Edeka.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderstand BEV Drivers and Fulfill Their Needs\\n\\n\\nThe rise of BEVs is disrupting consumer behaviors and will continue to as BEV adoption grows. Forward-thinking retail brands, convenience stores and QSRs recognize this shift as a catalyst for growth. The ability to meet consumers’ evolving expectations can contribute to retailers’ future success. The path forward lies in understanding the changing landscape, prioritizing BEV drivers’ evolving needs and investing strategically to deliver solutions that address BEV drivers’ pain points and desires.\\n\\n\\nOn May 21, 2024, we will host a free webinar, \\nHow the EV Revolution Will Upend the Energy, Retail, and Tech Landscapes\\n, on the US findings from this study and how best to position your business for success in this new world.\\n\\n\\nClick the button below to learn more and register if you’d like to join us—and stay tuned for a future webinar focused on our study’s European findings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more?

The evolving regulatory landscape, a growing appetite for connected technologies and the ever-present pressure to remain competitive are all prompting fleet businesses to investigate the benefits of telematics solutions.\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s Telematics Path to Purchase report from our \\nFleet Advisory Hub™ insights program\\n, which explores the needs, expectations and emotions of commercial vehicle and fleet decision-makers, aims to map this developing market by examining the process and behaviors exhibited by fleet decision-makers as they shop for, make decisions about, and ultimately onboard telematics solutions.\\n\\n\\nAs our data demonstrate, the fleet telematics market is still in the late stages of early adoption. Of the 1,000 fleet professionals we talked to, only one-third (34%) have adopted a telematics solution, with more than 80% being first-time buyers.\\n\\n\\nWith two-thirds of fleet leaders yet to lock in a telematics solution, there remains a significant opportunity for service providers to capture and expand their market share.\\n\\n\\nThe Impact of Word of Mouth on Fleet Decision-Makers\\n\\n\\nVarious factors are spurring fleet decision-makers to begin researching telematics solutions, but two stand out. Nearly half (44%) of decision-makers say a recommendation triggered their purchase journey. Further, around one-third (35%) report they began their search in response to an internal business improvement initiative wherein top-cited motivations include improving vehicle tracking (49%), increasing fleet productivity (41%) and enhancing safety (39%).\\n\\n\\nFor the 44% of fleet leaders following a recommendation to invest in telematics technology, 28% of recommendations came from industry peers, 25% from colleagues and 20% from telematics service providers (TSPs). This emphasis on word of mouth presents an opportunity for TSPs to enhance their penetration in the market through recommendations while simultaneously putting the onus on providers to ensure they consistently meet or exceed customer expectations and thus remain top of mind for potential referrals.\\n\\n\\nA Nonlinear Shopping Process for Fleet Telematics Solutions\\n\\n\\nOnce these professionals are engaged in the shopping process, the path to purchase is by no means linear or unilateral. On average, fleets involve two departments in the prepurchase phase—with 32% of businesses involving three or more departments. Further, 68% say they employ a joint decision-making process.\\n\\n\\nShoppers are taking their time when choosing a telematics provider, too. Those who have adopted the technology spent an average of eight months investigating solutions before implementing them. Our data indicate that new adopters will be even more deliberate in their research and planning. Current shoppers say they have already spent an average of seven months considering offerings and anticipate it will be another nine until they purchase and integrate a telematics solution into their fleet business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo successfully move fleets down the telematics purchase funnel, service providers will need to be sensitive to this dynamic, being able to identify where fleet decision-makers are in their telematics shopping journey and taking the time to deeply understand the objectives and needs of the fleet business in question. Then service providers can ensure their marketing strategies and consultative services align with their customers’ progress toward telematics procurement.\\n\\n\\nOpen Minds and Ample Opportunity for Telematics Providers\\n\\n\\nWhen weighing where to shop for a telematics solution, fleet leaders in our study gravitate toward a group of “big four” providers—two telecommunications brands and two vehicle manufacturers—that fleets are often already partnered with, and trust. More than one-third (36%) of decision-makers say Verizon Connect is in their consideration list. AT&T Fleet Complete ranks second (28%), followed by Ford Pro Telematics (27%) and OnStar Business Solutions (26%).\\n\\n\\nThat said, fleet shoppers are also curious about dedicated TSPs. Fourteen percent would include Geotab and TomTom in their consideration lists, and 11% would include Omnitracs and Samsara.\\n\\n\\nThere is space for other automotive industry partners to drive the purchase journey, too. While 57% of fleet leaders list TSPs as a shopping channel, vehicle manufacturers and dealers (38%), fleet management companies (35%) and transportation management system providers (27%) are also popular. With no majority leader among providers, these decision influencers could establish a foothold in the market by solidifying a partnership with a dedicated TSP.\\n\\n\\nConnecting Small and Mid-Sized Fleets With Telematics Solutions\\n\\n\\nAt present, fleets running at least 50 vehicles are setting the pace for adoption. Sixty-six percent of large fleets (500 vehicles or more) and 55% of mid-sized fleets (51 to 499 vehicles) say they have adopted telematics at some level. As smaller fleets come to the table, service providers typically find their demands differ from those of their larger counterparts. Providers must focus on developing flexible value propositions that resonate with a range of fleet stakeholders and reflect the needs of a variety of business models. This is vital for long-term growth as well as for the nearer-term opportunity to connect small and mid-sized fleets with telematics solutions that meet their objectives and smaller budgets.\\n\\n\\nFleet decision-making is collaborative and involved, and although the market has been shaped by the preferences of the largest players in the business, it is gradually shifting toward smaller fleets and mixed fleet businesses. The service providers who try to understand how fleets of all sizes are approaching the telematics purchase journey will be best placed to align their products and messaging with the expectations of the next generation of adopters and, in doing so, take the lead in connecting the fleet.\\n\\n\\nMoving the Telematics Market Beyond the Late Stages of Early Adoption\\n\\n\\nDespite existing for more than a decade, the telematics industry needs to move beyond early adopters. Fortunately, there is plenty of room for growth. Most fleet decision-makers have little unaided recall of telematics brands and, although the “big four” are trusted brands that have strong reputations and top the list for highest initial shopping consideration, there is ample opportunity to challenge them, as fleet leaders are open to shopping for telematics solutions through other partners in their circle.\\n\\n\\nTo grow mindshare among fleet decision-makers and establish leadership, telematics providers need to do three key things:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeeply understand the different telematics purchase journeys, objectives, challenges and needs of diverse fleet stakeholders and different business sizes\\n\\n\\nTailor offerings, marketing and value propositions/messaging to specific customers’ pain points and priorities\\n\\n\\nDeliver solutions that perform as promised, or better, and ensure strong post-sale customer experience to facilitate positive word-of-mouth recommendations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to learn more about our findings, Fleet Advisory Hub, or how our \\ncommercial vehicle and fleet experts\\n can help you grow your business, please reach out to us.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more?

In fact, when it comes to buying a car, I’m what you would call an EV Intender—someone who doesn’t own an electric vehicle but intends to buy one in the next three to five years, according to our \\nEVForward\\n®\\n study on the next generation of EV buyers\\n.\\n\\n\\nFor me, going on a road trip means looking at what EVs are on the road and thinking about which ones most appeal to me. It’s exciting to think about which EV I would purchase. When I first saw the upcoming plug-in hybrid Ford Bronco Sport, it was an absolute head turner! It’s retro cool and seductive enough to get me to make the switch from a regular gas vehicle. It’s also chic enough to be a lady’s car but rugged enough to carry my kids, dog, skis or mountain bike around South Lake Tahoe, where I live. Of course, the color of the car is a priority for me, and my color is red!\\n\\n\\nHow Life Would Be Different With an EV\\n\\n\\nOnce I got past envisioning the type of EV I wanted, the next biggest thing I had to consider was getting into the habit of charging my EV instead of going to the gas station. As I got more serious about what it meant to switch from a gas guzzler to a car that needs charging, I turned my attention to the realities of owning an EV and the behavioral shifts I’d need to make to accommodate this. Questions emerged as to where I’d charge during my road trips between Lake Tahoe and San Francisco and how long it’d take to juice up, even if my starter EV were a plug-in hybrid. I tried to recall whether the place I stop for my favorite latte already had EV charging stations. Contemplating this change led me to want more information about what EV owners were already doing. Clearly, it was market research time!\\n\\n\\nFast-forward, we conducted research in the US to find out more about where EV owners are charging and what retail EV charging locations have the biggest draw. Interestingly, this study sheds light on which retail brands are winning at EV charging and why.\\n\\n\\nWho’s Winning at Retail EV Charging and Why\\n\\n\\nI learned that quick-service restaurants (QSRs) are winning at EV charging because it takes 10–15 minutes longer to charge an EV than a typical stop and people want to eat. Now, my most frequented trip is to San Francisco, which is about 200 miles from Lake Tahoe and a 3.5-hour trek on a good day (meaning no snow and minimal traffic). I could go for an average of 230 miles without recharging, but that’s cutting it close and I would likely charge up halfway into the trip. It turns out that 200–400 miles is the most common road trip distance traveled among the EV owners and EV Intenders who responded to our study, so it’s likely that they’d also stop halfway to charge.\\n\\n\\nFor me, stopping for a charge means where is the closest Starbucks? For others, it means McDonald’s. Twenty-two percent of EV owners and EV Intenders also pick Starbucks but most prefer McDonald’s (54%), followed by Burger King (20%), with Subway, Chick-fil-A and Wendy’s being other top alternatives. However, across distances of 1,000 miles or more, McDonald’s, Starbucks and Wendy’s are the top three QSR stops.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps even more interesting is that Starbucks ranks seventh among these respondents when they are simply selecting a QSR on any given day but then jumps to second when it comes to road trips. The more hours people spend in the car, the more significant McDonald’s and Starbucks become. Is it the coffee?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEqually popular, 7-Eleven (46%) is consistently winning stops among convenience stores. I mention this because I, too, have stopped there when craving a Slurpee and a pepperoni stick during a seemingly endless road trip. The good news here is that I won’t have to change my behavior when charging on road trips; I can still hit up Starbucks and the occasional 7-Eleven when I need to satisfy a craving because both brands are investing in EV charging stations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI was surprised to learn that 42% of EV owners plan where they are going to stop and eat, most using Google Maps, Waze or Apple Maps (42%), an app like TripTik (29%), or an automaker-app such as FordPass (21%). These stops are likely planned because EV owners know it takes longer than a typical gas car stop to charge up. It’s interesting to learn that in everyday situations (not road trips), EV owners still select QSRs as their first choice (44%) for charging versus other venues such as big box retailers or convenience stores, and they are making the most of these visits. EV owners are 72% more likely to go to a venue to dine or shop while they charge.\\n\\n\\nWhere’s the Opportunity for QSRs With EV Charging?\\n\\n\\nIn a world where many eat in their cars and order takeout, EV charging represents a unique opportunity to get people back into the restaurant during the time it takes their battery to power up. Tables and chairs set QSRs apart from convenience stores like 7-Eleven when competing for EV charging time. Additionally, it’s a moment for disruption, a time when gas stations are rethinking their identity. It puts QSRs in a unique position to rebuild their post-pandemic in-store relationship with consumers.\\n\\n\\nAs an EV Intender, I’ve identified two compelling opportunities for quick-service restaurants:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLoyalty Programs and EV Charging Integration:\\n Thirty-two percent of consumers are keen on linking EV charging to rewards. QSRs can seize this opportunity by expanding their loyalty programs. Imagine a scenario where patrons not only earn points for food and beverage purchases but also for EV charging. For instance, could a certain QSR offer a discount on meal purchases when patrons charge their EVs? Or perhaps a delightful combo deal where a Happy Meal purchase comes with discounted EV charging? By intertwining these incentives, QSRs can enhance customer loyalty while encouraging sustainable practices.\\n\\n\\nFamily-Friendly Experiences:\\n Remember the joy of road trips as a child when a stop at McDonald’s meant playtime and excitement? Sixteen percent of EV owners and EV Intenders share this sentiment—they want to entertain their kids during travel. Notably, Millennials (27%) are most likely to have young children. Furthermore, 12% of EV owners specifically seek places to walk their dogs. Especially among Gen Z, this desire to accommodate furry companions jumps to 25%, although it represents a substantial market across generations (Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X and Boomers). Therefore, QSRs can create family-friendly environments that cater to both human and canine guests. After all, road trips often involve kids, dogs and the promise of memorable experiences.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the convergence of EV charging, family outings and tasty treats presents exciting prospects for QSRs. Meantime, I’m still dreaming about my red, plug-in hybrid Ford Bronco Sport. I’m recognizing that I’m going to need to be more mindful about planning my stops and hoping that by the time I become an EV owner, QSRs will have something to offer the entire family.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to learn more about our study’s findings and how your brand can grow by seizing the opportunities that come with EV charging, join me and my colleagues K.C.

Consumers are considering automotive brands and vehicle segments they haven’t before. Consumers who own battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are learning about new brands that offer charging networks for their BEVs and they are changing their shopping behaviors in favor of retailers, convenience stores (also known as C-stores) and quick-serve restaurants (QSRs) that fit into their new life as a BEV owner.\\n\\n\\nNearly 8% of new-car sales in 2023 were electric vehicles in the United States, and Escalent’s \\nEVForward® study on the next generation of EV buyers\\n found that a full one-quarter of new-car buyers are “EV Intenders,” meaning, consumers who are most likely to purchase a BEV as their next car. The accelerating e-mobility transition doesn’t just impact automakers; it also has ripple effects on how people “fuel” their transportation and where they spend their time and money while charging their BEV. Forward-thinking brands such as \\n7-Eleven\\n, \\nWalmart\\n, \\nCircle K\\n and \\nStarbucks\\n, recognizing these effects, have begun building out BEV charging infrastructure to capture a more significant share of this shifting retail spending.\\n\\n\\nBut are these strategies likely to succeed? Over 70% of BEV charging happens at home, and installing BEV charging infrastructure is expensive, with a single DC fast charging (DCFC) unit running into the six figures for equipment and installation. Escalent recently partnered with \\nPureSpectrum\\n to survey BEV owners and purchase intenders to understand how the e-mobility transition will shift consumer spending and how retail brands can win.\\n\\n\\nVarious BEV Use Cases Play Out Differently for Retail, Convenience Store and Quick-Serve Restaurant Locations\\n\\n\\nWith the vast majority of BEV charging happening at home, we examined three different “journeys” and their impact on retail, QSR and C-store brands:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRoad trips.\\n Nearly three-quarters (72%) of drivers say they take a road trip outside their local area at least once a year. BEV drivers typically seek out DCFCs during road trips, which can replenish the battery in as little as 15 minutes, but may seek out slower (e.g., Level 2 or 240-volt) charging at and around their destination.\\n\\n\\nLocal BEV charging. \\nThis is charging done on a day-to-day basis that is necessary for the driver’s commute, errands or other mobility needs. This charging can happen either through a DCFC or Level 2 depending on the driver’s needs and may serve as a draw to an establishment with these chargers.\\n\\n\\nBEV opportunity charging.\\n This charging is done simply because a charger is where the BEV driver is, not because it’s necessary for mobility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Great American (BEV) Road Trip\\n\\n\\nFew drivers (4%, to be precise) approach a road trip by driving straight from their origin to their destination; the majority report making one to four stops during their trip. For most drivers, these stops last 10 to 20 minutes and most frequently consist of stops for fuel, fast food, fresh air, bathroom breaks, and getting up to stretch and walk around. While stops for fresh air are typically spontaneous, consumers are roughly split between preplanning for fuel and stopping spontaneously for fast food.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBEV drivers display different behavior, with nearly four in ten (38%) preplanning their recharging stops and a further one-quarter searching while en route for the best stop. As a result, retailers looking to attract traffic from BEV drivers need to adjust their strategy to ensure visibility in route planning software (e.g., Chargeway, A Better Routeplanner, PlugShare, Google Maps) and in-vehicle navigation. Furthermore, while decisions to stop for fast food are generally shared between the driver and passenger(s), 57% of BEV drivers say it was their decision alone about where to stop to charge.\\n\\n\\nMcDonald’s captures most (54%) fast-food stops, followed by Starbucks at 22%. Although Starbucks is a distant second, it punches above its weight since it’s tied for the fifth most-preferred fast-food restaurant overall. As a result, Starbucks may be well-positioned to capture increasing traffic from BEV drivers if it expands its current BEV charging pilot program nationally.\\n\\n\\nOn the fueling front, 7-Eleven, Shell and Circle K captures most drivers’ stops. All three brands are actively building out BEV charging networks nationally and, thus, are well-positioned to defend their market share. One-fifth of BEV drivers say they have stopped to charge at a Shell Recharge station. Other fuel brands such as Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Speedway must act quickly on building out BEV charging networks to remain relevant in an increasingly BEV world.\\n\\n\\nBEV Charging Around Town\\n\\n\\nRetail and QSR brands are featured heavily in BEV drivers’ most convenient places to charge around town and, therefore, have an opportunity to attract additional traffic as increasing numbers of drivers purchase BEVs. In fact, two-thirds (66%) of drivers say they’d be more likely to shop or dine at a business that has installed Level 2 electric vehicle charging; that number rises to 77% for businesses that have installed DCFC.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne way retailers can make BEV charging more “sticky” is to incorporate charging into their loyalty programs. Nearly half (47%) of drivers say they would be more likely to charge their BEV at a business that offered discounts on purchases while they charge, and a further 44% say they’d be more likely to choose a business that allows them to use their reward points to pay for charging.\\n\\n\\nBEV Opportunity Charging Likely to Increase Average In-Store Retail and QSR Purchase Amount\\n\\n\\nNearly half (45%) of drivers say that, even if they didn’t need to charge their vehicle, if BEV charging was available at a business they visited, then they would spend more time in the store to allow their vehicle to charge more.\\n\\n\\nCustomers spending more time in the establishment would likely result in a higher average purchase ticket, and the business impact of this kind of opportunity charging would be likely to accrue to those brands if, like Walmart, 7-Eleven, Starbucks and Circle K, they invest in BEV charging for their customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA New BEV World, New Opportunities for Retail, C-Stores and QSRs\\n\\n\\nForward-thinking retail brands recognize the growing number of BEV drivers as an opportunity to grow their business through a combination of higher traffic (more BEV drivers patronizing the business) and higher average purchase ticket (BEV drivers spending more time in the establishment).\\n\\n\\nJoin us on May 21, 2024, at 1 pm EDT for a webinar with further findings from this study and insights on how best to position your business for success in this new world.

It also makes it easier for electric utilities to manage their grids in a world where intermittent renewable resources constitute an ever-increasing share of power generation. But our latest \\nEVForward®\\n\\xa0Charging Experience DeepDive found that, at present, awareness of—and openness to—the technology is lagging.\\n\\n\\nThe EVForward Charging Experience DeepDive report examines consumer attitudes toward and experiences with BEV charging. The recent study uncovered a wide range of findings about the BEV charging experience at home and on the road, including new insight into the \\nwell-documented concerns\\n and frustrations with public charging.\\n\\n\\nThe study also examined sentiments toward emerging vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities. The results suggest that, for many consumers, these technologies only deepen long-standing anxieties around battery life and replacement cost.\\n\\n\\nCautious Optimism Toward V2X—And Cause for Concern\\n\\n\\nVehicle-to-everything (V2X) programs don’t just provide benefits to vehicle owners—they could also contribute to a more resilient energy ecosystem. V2G programs facilitate a bidirectional flow between BEVs and the power grid. This allows BEV owners to sell power back to the grid during periods of high demand. Along with offsetting energy demand, this could promote further integration of renewable energy infrastructure into the grid.\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, V2H capabilities allow BEV owners to use their vehicles as emergency power sources during an outage. When asked about V2H, buyers indicated cautious optimism. According to our data, the feature has a +23 net positive impact on BEV purchase intention, a figure that rises to +46 among electric vehicle purchase intenders.\\n\\n\\nHowever, while respondents like the idea of having a backup power source for emergencies, many are concerned about the effect on the BEV battery. Some doubt the BEV battery could power the home for an extended period. Others worry they would be left without a working vehicle after draining the BEV’s power reserves.\\n\\n\\nMaking a Case for V2G\\n\\n\\nA narrow majority of consumers (56%) told Escalent they would be somewhat likely or likely to use a V2G program. Those in favor cited the financial advantage of selling excess power as their primary motivator. However, as with V2H, respondents are worried about wear and tear on the BEV battery.\\n\\n\\nBased on our calculations, if a utility company offered a $1/kWh premium for exported power, then BEV owners would need to send 14 charge cycles to the grid each year to break even on the cost of installing a bidirectional charger. This is the equivalent to adding roughly 3,000 miles to the vehicle battery annually. These calculations are based on average figures around battery capacity, length of vehicle ownership, and the cost to install a bidirectional charger.\\n\\n\\nTo get vehicle buyers on board with the concept, utility companies need to help new-car buyers understand the economics of V2G by making a clear financial case for selling power back to the grid. There is also an opportunity here for automakers to address any anxiety about the impact on battery life by creating and communicating vehicle warranties that cover V2X applications.\\n\\n\\nConsumer Appetite for Cost-Savings With BEVs and V2X\\n\\n\\nUtility companies and automakers shouldn’t underestimate consumer concerns about the cost of installing a home charger—the leading concern among new-car buyers (61%)—and the cost of charging the vehicle itself. More than half (57%) of respondents told Escalent they are worried about the cost of charging their BEV at home. Fifty-four percent said the same about using public direct current fast chargers (DCFCs), and 50% for public level two chargers.\\n\\n\\nIn-line with these findings, utility-led efforts to offset the cost of BEV charging have proven popular among consumers. The majority of respondents told us they would be likely to use programs that reduce energy prices based on time of use (79%), green power (73%) or demand response (70%). In addition, 76% said they would opt in to a program that offered discounted rates for charging with a specific charge point operator. This enthusiasm for cost-savings suggests one promising avenue for framing the advantages of V2X programs to vehicle shoppers.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, in the case of both V2G and V2H, up-front cost is a hurdle. When asked if they would use their BEV’s V2H feature if installing a home integration system cost $11,000 (which is the average price we found upon conducting \\nsecondary market research\\n), respondents balked at the price tag. Only 19% said they would be at least somewhat likely to use the technology in this scenario.\\n\\n\\nOur data show an appetite for V2H, but to tap into this, utilities and automakers need to home in on what consumers are willing to pay and find creative ways to reduce the cost of equipment and installation.\\n\\n\\nCrafting a New Narrative About the Value of V2X\\n\\n\\nWhile the vast majority of BEV owners said they have \\nnever run out of charge\\n, anxiety around the range and longevity of BEV batteries is frequently cited by consumers as a barrier to BEV adoption. Automakers and utility companies risk exacerbating these concerns if they fail to position V2H and V2G effectively. As such, they must develop engaging value propositions that emphasize the advantages of V2H and V2G while debunking common misconceptions about BEV batteries.\\n\\n\\nWith just one in four vehicle buyers being somewhat or very familiar with V2H and fewer than one in five with V2G, there is a need for robust marketing efforts to raise awareness of the programs and their advantages. But this also provides an opportunity. Since many consumers know little or nothing about the technology, utilities and automakers have a chance to craft a compelling narrative about V2X.\\n\\n\\nV2H and V2G both offer capabilities that resonate with vehicle buyers. However, to harness the potential of V2X, utility companies and automakers must align their messaging more closely with consumer desires and needs. By showing how V2X capacities can help rather than hinder the BEV ownership experience, companies can foster greater acceptance of—and enthusiasm for—the technology, paving the way for broader BEV adoption.\\n\\n\\nIf you are interested in learning more about our BEV research findings or talking about how we can help you reach consumers with your V2X offerings, please click the button below.'}\n","{'Index': 12, 'Heading': 'Four Reasons 2023 Was Game-Changing for Battery Electric Vehicles', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/four-reasons-2023-was-game-changing-for-battery-electric-vehicles/', 'Content': '2023 was a big year for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), not only because more than one million BEVs sold for the first time in the US but also because the industry was wrestling with the facts that BEV adoption isn’t linear, there are different motivations for today’s BEV consumers than previous buyers, and the magnitude of needed investments doesn’t always create an immediate return.\\n\\n\\nThroughout the year, Escalent tracked key topics with our monthly \\nEVForward\\n Pulse surveys and newsletters.\\n\\n\\nHere are our top four takeaways that made 2023 a seminal year for BEV adoption.\\n\\n\\n1. Mixed Outcomes on the Industry’s Adoption of NACS\\n\\n\\nFord dropped perhaps \\nthe\\n surprise of the year, announcing in May it would be adopting Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS, now codified as SAE J3400) for its future BEVs. Other brands quickly followed suit and nearly the entire industry has subsequently announced the adoption of NACS.\\n\\n\\nOur July Pulse reported that consumers felt “excited,” “happy” and “intrigued” by these announcements and found that buyers are more likely to consider brands that are adopting NACS. Conversely, consumers are less likely to consider brands that haven’t adopted NACS. In general, consumers don’t like standard wars (think: VHS vs. Betamax or, more recently, lightning vs. USB-C), and they reacted favorably to automakers unifying around a standard for charging.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite this, we found that more than half of prospective BEV buyers would likely delay their purchase until the vehicle they want has the NACS port built in. This means that a substantial number of buyers would probably sit on the sidelines until 2025 model year vehicles are available late this year or early next year, dampening the pace of BEV adoption.\\n\\n\\n2. Hyundai’s Kevin Bacon Ad Wins the Super Bowl\\n\\n\\nIn April, the Pulse examined the impact of Super Bowl ads on new-car buyers. Two-thirds of buyers reported watching the Super Bowl and about half recalled seeing car ads during the game. The \\nHyundai Ioniq 6 ad featuring Kevin Bacon\\n and \\nJeep’s electric boogie ad\\n best intrigued potential buyers, with 21% saying they’d want to learn more about the vehicles after seeing the ads.\\n\\n\\nHowever, out of the five BEV-related Super Bowl ads, Hyundai was the only one posting a higher percentage of viewers saying the ad made them more likely to consider a BEV than less likely to consider one. Aside from Kevin Bacon’s natural persuasiveness, this ad was effective because it focused on things prospective BEV buyers care about, namely range and charging speed. Competing Super Bowl ads weren’t as clear about what the vehicle offered or were implicitly or explicitly negative about BEVs. (e.g., RAM’s Premature Electrification ad).\\n\\n\\n3. Most Buyers Are Still “BEV Noobs”\\n\\n\\nBuyers overwhelmingly relate their expectations of owning BEVs to their experience with gas cars—it’s what they’ve always known. However, several aspects of BEV ownership differ quite substantially from gas car ownership, including how consumers would “fuel” the vehicle and maximize the vehicle range. Our June Pulse examined “BEV 101” and what the industry needs to do to help drivers understand the reality of owning a BEV.\\n\\n\\nWith driving range a key factor in BEV consideration, the plurality (29%) of buyers look to EPA range ratings as the most accurate representation of a BEV’s range. Furthermore, more than half (54%) expect interstate conditions, driving 60+ mph, to be where they’re most likely to reach a BEV’s maximum range. These expectations create the conditions for a poor experience, as many manufacturers’ BEVs fail to meet their EPA range in highway driving conditions.\\n\\n\\nCharging is another area where consumers need help. Nearly one-third are unsure what they would need to charge a BEV at a public charging station. Additionally, the most-selected response of “a charger that matches my vehicle’s charge rate” isn’t entirely accurate given that BEVs can successfully use higher- or lower-powered chargers at charging stations. For example, a BEV that maxes out at 150 kW can use a higher-powered charger (e.g., 350 kW, though the vehicle will only charge up to 150 kW, limited by the vehicle) or a lower-powered charger (e.g., 50 kW, though the vehicle will only charge up to 50 kW, limited by the charger).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuyers overwhelmingly want to learn about these topics when they first begin shopping and our May Pulse found that consumers are open to renting a BEV—even before they’ve started shopping for one—which presents a good learning opportunity. In fact, 63% of new-car buyers reported that there has been a time when their opinion of a vehicle brand has become more positive after renting.\\n\\n\\n4. Momentum Is Still Strong for BEVs\\n\\n\\nWhile several major automakers publicly expressed concern about a slowing rate of growth in BEV sales and concerns about the profitability of BEVs, buyers aren’t picking up on these concerns. In our December Pulse, 74% of consumers said that BEVs are growing in popularity (versus only 26% saying they’re declining). Additionally, 69% believe automakers are turning a profit on every BEV they sell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall, two-and-a-half-times as many new-car buyers said their outlook on BEVs is moving in a positive direction compared with the 17% who said their outlook on BEVs is becoming more negative. This is backed by a historically high number of buyers we identified as EV Intenders (new-car buyers who are the most likely to purchase a BEV as their next vehicle) through our proprietary propensity model: a full quarter of the market is likely to shop for a BEV as their next vehicle.\\n\\n\\nWhat Will 2024 Bring?\\n\\n\\nOur January Pulse covered predictions from three Escalent experts for the coming year. Because the consumer is at the center of everything we do, we compared these predictions with consumer sentiment to see how well the predictions held up in the market. While Pulse subscribers get the full rundown, it turns out our predictions fared well in the face of consumer data.\\n\\n\\nFebruary’s Pulse will examine the potential impact of Chinese OEMs entering the US market. With BYD taking the global BEV sales crown from Tesla as well as Chinese OEMs entering the European market in force and building a foothold in Mexico, it’s only time until China’s extremely price-competitive BEV offerings enter the US market.\\n\\n\\nIf you’re interested in getting timely updates on the state of the BEV market, click below for more information on how your organization can subscribe to the EVForward Pulse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout EVForward\\nTM\\n\\n\\nData reported within come from Escalent’s EVForward monthly Pulse surveys conducted in April, May, June, July and December 2023 among a subset of the EVForward US database, a sample of more than 40,000 new-vehicle buyers age 18 to 80 with a primary vehicle model 2018 or newer and intending to purchase a new vehicle within the next five years.

Surprisingly, consumer enthusiasm and confidence in EVs have plateaued rather than continue the positive momentum we saw between 2021 and 2022.\\n\\n\\nAs part of EVForward Europe, we identified six unique European EV buyer personas and their likelihood to adopt EVs. Two personas that have led EV adoption to date entered the EV market due to hard convictions: the Pillar persona recognised the environmental benefits of EVs to society while the Pioneer was excited by the latest technology.\\n\\n\\nThe third persona in line is the Influencer—a group more likely to enter the EV market when it is safely cool to be seen as an adopter, effectively wearing a fashionable set of new clothes or driving a tech-forward EV that projects to the peer group a trendy, progressive person. However, choosing when to make a fashion statement can be transient and subjective and will not take place if there are doubts.\\n\\n\\nWhat Happened to European Consumers’ Positive EV Sentiment?\\n\\n\\nIn 2023 fewer new-car buyers regard EVs as “the future.” The slip to “interesting idea” from 36% in 2022 to 40% in 2023 suggests that, in recent times, consumers have not seen some of the anticipated EV maturity momentum. Instead of increasing confidence in EVs, the lack of progress in EVs being perceived as the future means EVs have not shed their “work-in-progress” status in the minds of consumers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile large majorities of the Pillar and Pioneer persona groups continue to view EVs as “the future,” only 21% of Influencers are similarly confident—a decrease of three percentage points from 2022. Consequently, only 8% of Influencers intend to buy an EV as their next car whereas similar, much larger shares think that plug-in hybrids are a better option or will wait for the EV that feels right for them.\\n\\n\\nAlthough most see home charging as their main option, everyone needs a plan B up their sleeve—the ability to rely at least occasionally on public charging infrastructure. Reassurance about being able to rely on public charging comes, in part, from seeing charging options. In 2023, the level of increased recognition of charging infrastructure has not achieved the same level of improvement seen between 2021 and 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEven among current EV owners there are some doubts about the viability of EVs as a proposition. Among those who found the EV ownership experience better than expected, nearly 25% state they would not buy an EV next time.\\n\\n\\nAll these factors combine to create a sense that the maturation momentum of the overall EV proposition is running behind. In order to extend that momentum, the whole EV concept needs a timely “fast charge.”\\n\\n\\nImproving the Value Proposition of EVs\\n\\n\\nIncreasing EV charging infrastructure is both complicated and costly and not directly under the control of automotive manufacturers. What is under the control of automakers is developing a deep understanding of the user experience and effectively positioning EVs.\\n\\n\\nAlthough most new-car buyers recognise the environmental benefits of EVs, these factors are not necessarily motivating when it comes to the purchase process. There is a need to rotate the EV proposition so that potential buyers can recognise other characteristics that can influence purchase.\\n\\n\\nEVForward Europe 2023 results also indicate that EV buyers would benefit from more support than they currently receive from their EV brands. Gone are the days when a car purchase was a one-off transaction every few years at best—there is now a great opportunity for brands to play the role of trusted advisor throughout the EV ownership experience. By combining trusted techniques with new communications technology and over-the-air vehicle software updates, automakers can facilitate a richer, more meaningful relationship with their customers that can be mutually beneficial throughout the EV ownership tenure. Furthermore, the more EV owners who have positive ownership experiences, the more they will endorse EVs among their peers, which will positively influence non-EV owners to consider EVs.\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to learn more about our findings or how we can help you refine your EV strategy to gain market momentum, click the button below to connect with us.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout EVForward™ Europe\\n\\n\\nThe EVForward Europe study was conducted across five European countries: France (n=1,968), Germany (n=1,999), Italy (n=2,052), Spain (n=2,048) and the United Kingdom (n=2,115). It was a market-representative sample of 10,182 respondents and included a survey that fielded between June 30 and July 31, 2023. These respondents are aged 18 to 80 with a primary vehicle model 2017 or newer and are planning to purchase a new vehicle within the next five years. Data were weighted by age and gender to match the demographics of the new-vehicle buyer population and by vehicle segment to match current vehicle sales. The sample for this research comes from an opt-in, online panel. As such, any reported margins of error or significance tests are estimated and rely on the same statistical assumptions as data collected from a random probability sample.

But now, in an era of globalization, disruption and digitalization, the biggest shifts are driven by what people expect of brands.\\n\\n\\nMeToo, The Cost-of-Living Crisis, The Greta Effect. What started as localized, one-off events have turned into global movements that have profoundly affected the tradeoffs consumers are willing to make. Simply put, expectations are much higher, and for brands to win in this environment, they need to learn to give as much as they seek to get.\\n\\n\\nOur hypothesis is that we’re on the cusp of a new phase in business. In a relationship economy, customers (and employees) will seek out brands that feel invested in them. For businesses, brand-customer relationships will become the most important source of competitive advantage.\\n\\n\\nBut relationships are difficult. They take time to build and maintain. They demand compromises, lateral thinking, bravery. In this blog, we’ll explore the evolving landscape and provide recommendations for how to keep your customers at the center of your business in 2024 and beyond.\\n\\n\\nThe Crises That Keep Coming Impact Brands, Customers and Relationships\\n\\n\\nThink back to January 2020. It’s a normal, end-of-boom cycle, and it looks like the recessionary doomsayers might have gotten it wrong. Come April, we’re facing a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic that shuts down the global economy and disrupts every aspect of our daily lives. By October, the stimulus brings the economy roaring back: home improvement and home fitness takes off, Zoom skyrockets to success, and the valuation of delivery services like Instacart and DoorDash soars. And let’s not forget about vaccine-fueled revenge travel.\\n\\n\\nIn the fall of 2022, inflation rears its menacing head and one year later consumers are barely hanging on. Credit card debt is at an all-time high and, for the first-time ever, new homes are cheaper than existing homes as people are staying put, clinging to their low mortgage rates.\\n\\n\\nAs brands place their bets for 2024, they should be asking whether next year will bring a return to “normal” or more of the same. Here’s why we think the latter:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSince the beginning of 2023, we’ve been in what can only be considered a rolling recession\\n. First technology. Then banks. And we think there are some obvious candidates for who’s next (we’re looking at you, commercial real estate market, \\nretail\\n, utilities, and automotive). While housing isn’t in a recession yet, due to fixed-rate mortgages in the US, people aren’t selling their homes, which has created a frozen equilibrium due to suppressed demand. \\nUK home sales in 2023\\n are also predicted to be “the lowest in a decade.”\\n\\n\\nThe Fed may need to break the job market to finish the job on inflation. \\n\\nGovernments across the globe have borrowed so much money that they cannot allow inflation to continue. So, breaking the job market becomes the better choice for the system even though it’s the worst choice for humans. What the Fed does will impact the global economy.\\n\\n\\nMajor conflicts raging in Europe and the Middle East and a divisive US election will continue to shake consumer confidence\\n.\\n\\nA negative shock to consumer confidence will result in a decline in real GDP. Latest predictions from the former president of the European Central Bank are for the \\nEU to tip into recession soon\\n, triggered partly by the war in Ukraine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reality is big, external events have a sneaky way of impacting you and me. And when consumer confidence is lower, so is spending. And, in this context, the relationships between brands and people are turned upside-down.\\n\\n\\nThe Era of Relationship Thinking\\n\\n\\nIn this age of uncertainty, people are re-evaluating what value means to them and what brands can do for them. This means brands need to adopt a new paradigm when creating new services, products or experiences, and seek to give as much as they seek to get.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKnowing who you’re for\\n: Brands are increasingly challenged to fight internal biases and bring more diversity in how they operate, so they are better prepared to navigate generational and demographic shifts. For example, the US population will soon be more Hispanic and non-White. Research shows there are also growing concerns about the \\nimpact of Gen Z\\n on the workplace—including demands for companies to prioritize purpose and a diverse, inclusive corporate culture. Brands could take \\nMcDonald’s \\nas an example for having literally embedded teenagers’ voices within the wider business and having, as a result, created marketing that has been praised for its representation, creativity, effectiveness and innovation.\\n\\n\\nShowing up where it really matters\\n: It’s not just about knowing your customers; it’s about liking them. The emergence of AI is raising the bar on these digital experiences and expectations, but it’s difficult for brands to find the right balance between technological efficiency and human connections. Especially with higher scrutiny on cost and spend. So, how can your brand strategy think first about what is good for people and how to language emotionally, rather than (just) what is good for their bottom line?\\n\\n\\nReimagining the value exchange\\n: With high interest, inflation and the cost-of-living crisis, consumers are re-evaluating what really matters. A new C Space & Hall & Partners global study, \\nValue – Relationships Under Duress\\n,\\xa0illustrates just how far people are making trade-offs across category, rather than just trading down. Worryingly we’re seeing people having to make radical choices that sometimes jeopardize their long-term chances.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelationship thinking is the new ways brands should learn to operate, so they put diversity at the heart of how they build stuff and show up with more empathy and humanity. In practice, this means staying close to people and culture all the time.\\n\\n\\nThe New Role Of Insights: Embedding Relational Intelligence, Long-Term\\n\\n\\nThe relationships between a brand and its customers are built always-on: through the big moments like your Christmas campaign, and the smaller ones, like the smile of the person handing you your latte. So should the way you connect with (all) customers internally.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen the line and never hang up: \\nMarket Research Online Communities\\n (MROCs) enable an always-on conversation and relationship with smaller and truly representative audiences members. They not only act as the perfect mechanism to stay in tune with these value shifts but also act as a trojan horse in your business—making it impossible for stakeholders to not talk to real people and hear real stories.\\n\\n\\nNever stop listening: \\nCreating space for ongoing and meaningful conversation, based on openness and trust, means that people will raise problems to you, rather than the other way around, as is usually the case. So, it’s not just a space for you to ask questions but also for people to express themselves and point out things you’re not necessarily thinking about. And, if you’re listening closely, this is often where the next breakthrough comes from.\\n\\n\\nTrack what matters to them, not just to you:\\n Collaborating with your customers through insights to align what you do with what they need is your best chance of navigating choppy waters. Remember that purchase and brand journeys are not the same. You have an on-going brand relationship with your customers and prospects influenced by anything and everything. So, keeping a regular pulse on your brand equity and nurturing customer relationships is more important than ever to help fuel your future growth potential by inspiring ideas, action, and a customer-centric culture. A trusted market research and insights partner can help you better understand and connect with customers through current and future disruption.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want more details on what brands can do to respond with more empathy and clarity in the cost-of living crisis era, download our new study, Value: Relationships Under Duress.

Issuing the second edition of its Fleet Electrification Brand Landscape Report, the study surveyed almost 1,000 fleet decision-makers to capture the perspectives of those on the front lines of the sector on the state of BEV adoption and their brand perceptions.\\n\\n\\nOf the participating fleet leaders, 23% indicated that their business has brought a battery electric vehicle (BEV) into their fleet, a \\n35% year-over-year increase\\n. Even so, in-market BEV penetration remains at only around 1%. This indicates that the majority of fleets are integrating one or two BEVs at a time rather than replacing large portions of inventory—leading to less market traction than many expect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoing beyond early adopters to tap into and move more risk-averse mainstream market businesses down the purchase funnel, manufacturers will need real-world ways to demonstrate BEV reliability and performance.\\n\\n\\nA Halo Effect for Established Automakers\\n\\n\\nIn terms of brand perception, little has shifted in our study in the last 12 months. Tesla has maintained its edge in the light passenger vehicle segment, with 39% of fleet decision-makers ranking it as the leader in the market. Ford, meanwhile, is the front-runner in the commercial van, commercial pickup truck and medium/heavy-duty segments.\\n\\n\\nWhile Ford enjoys a commanding lead in the van, pickup truck and medium/heavy-duty segments, its year-over-year leadership score has dropped slightly in all three categories. Similarly, Tesla’s leadership score has decreased by one percentage point in the light passenger vehicle segment.\\n\\n\\nA halo effect is still at work for established brands, allowing them to dominate in leadership rankings. Legacy automakers have the advantage of long-standing relationships with fleet decision-makers—and the reputation that comes with decades in the game.\\n\\n\\nNevertheless, there is hope on the horizon for emerging automakers. While start-ups lag in awareness and familiarity metrics, those who recognize the companies often rate them on par with segment averages for positive opinion and consideration.\\n\\n\\nIn the commercial truck segment, for instance, only 21% of decision-makers reported a favorable opinion of Rivian as a BEV manufacturer. Just 10% said the same about Bollinger. However, among those familiar with the brand, this measure rose to 53% for both companies. If these new players can increase their top-of-funnel awareness, they could gain traction among a broader group of vehicle buyers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRivian Pulls Ahead\\n\\n\\nWithin the cohort of start-ups included in the study, one stands out—Rivian.\\n\\n\\nRivian outperforms its start-up peers in commercial van and pickup truck segments for familiarity, positive opinion, consideration and leadership perception. Moreover, among those who are acquainted with the automaker, Rivian proves competitive with the overall segment average for consideration in the commercial pickup truck segment.\\n\\n\\nThe Amazon-backed manufacturer previously announced a partnership with the e-commerce giant to get \\n100,000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by 2030\\n, with some of these units more recently hitting the roadways\\n. One of the most prominent fleet collaborations to date, this likely afforded Rivian a boost in recognition. If the brand can continue to build familiarity and provide a solid customer experience, it could become a successful disruptor.\\n\\n\\nOpportunities to Improve the EV Experience\\n\\n\\nVarious factors are likely tempering brand evaluations. These could run the gamut from disappointment with in-market products to long wait times for new models. Perhaps most importantly, though, the peripherals related to customer and ownership experience in the EV ecosystem remain a significant obstacle. When ranking the top challenges to adoption, almost 35% of decision-makers noted driving range. Time to charge, along with battery life and replacement costs, closely follows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo commit to electrifying their fleets, companies must feel confident that elements such as charging infrastructure and battery life and replacement costs can meet their expectations. Automakers are pursuing a variety of approaches to address these issues. A consortium of seven manufacturers recently joined forces to launch a \\nnew EV charging network\\n. Others are \\nstriking deals with Tesla\\n to grant customers access to its nationwide North American Charging Standard (NACS) connectors network.\\n\\n\\nA “Prove-It Approach” to Crossing the BEV Chasm\\n\\n\\nWith the current tempered reality of the electrification landscape aside, 40% of decision-makers said they consider BEVs to be the future of managing the fleet business. So, how can automakers entice companies to cross the chasm? Fleet decision-makers want evidence that BEVs can deliver.\\n\\n\\nPilot test programs prove to be the most popular model in spurring adoption. Fifty-two percent of fleet leaders stated that partnering with a company to try out BEVs at a low, fixed cost would make them more likely to contemplate the switch. In addition, decision-makers demonstrate enthusiasm for models that offer turnkey solutions and fleet-as-a-service. Both could help to address the steep infrastructure and learning curves posed by the integration and management of BEVs.\\n\\n\\nOngoing education also has a role to play. In its \\n“Run on Less – Electric” program\\n, the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE) works with fleets already using BEVs to collect data on the benefits and difficulties of fleet electrification. Projects like these can enable smaller businesses that don’t have the resources to take on new risks to better understand the realities of managing BEVs.\\n\\n\\nA Push for Change in the Regulatory Landscape\\n\\n\\nIn the past few years, much has changed to encourage the adoption of BEVs. Through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the federal government is offering a clean vehicle tax credit of up to $40,000 for electric commercial vehicles. A billion-dollar pool of grants and rebates is also available through states, local governments and municipalities.\\n\\n\\nIn addition, proposed regulations from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—along with state-level initiatives such as two California Air Resource Board (CARB) sister rulings—are designed to increase the proportion of zero and near-zero emission vehicles on the road in the next 10 to 15 years. CARB’s Advanced Clean Truck (ACT) rule is aimed at commercial vehicle manufacturers and the vehicles they produce, while the Advanced Clean Fleet (ACF) ruling is targeted at businesses that buy and operate vehicles.\\n\\n\\nAll that said, a wide variety of businesses operate within the fleet market and, thus far, both regulations and manufacturers have focused much of the electrification push on larger companies. Although this has been to the near-term detriment of small and medium businesses, it does provide an opportunity for vehicle manufacturers and service providers to take learnings from the enterprise level and scale them down to make BEV adoption more manageable for the smaller fleets.\\n\\n\\nA Dynamic Road Ahead on the BEV Adoption Curve\\n\\n\\nGiven the nuances making most businesses unique, automakers must work to align the promise of the electrified fleet with the expectations and needs of each customer. BEVs are more than just the vehicles fleets have always known—BEVs represent a paradigm shift to a further sprawling ecosystem of services and functions. Manufacturers and service providers must shift with them, where every element of the BEV ownership experience will need to be rock solid to attract and retain fleet customers, and many decision-makers are waiting for more evidence that BEVs can live up to their promise.\\n\\n\\nContrary to many headlines, the commercial vehicle and fleet industry remains in the early stages of the BEV adoption curve and the path to fleet electrification will be dynamic, complex and sometimes unpredictable. This is a challenge for both vehicle manufacturers and service providers, as well as companies operating vehicles. This is a journey on a winding road that will take time, testing, flexibility and patience to overcome.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to learn more about our study findings or how we can help you better understand the journey and perspectives of commercial vehicle and fleet businesses in their transition to BEVs, please click the button below to send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 16, 'Heading': 'Multifamily Housing EV Charging: What Is and Isn’t a Barrier to EV Adoption', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/multifamily-ev-charging-what-is-and-isnt-a-barrier-to-adoption/', 'Content': 'In our discussions with electric vehicle (EV) stakeholders, including automakers, utilities and policymakers, we often hear concerns about how people who live in multifamily housing (i.e., apartments and condominiums) can charge their EVs and whether that presents a barrier to adoption.\\n\\n\\nOur recent \\nEVs for EVeryone\\n study found that, nationally, approximately 25% of car buyers live in multifamily housing. However, that national figure disguises areas where multifamily housing is much more prevalent. For example, 39% of respondents in Cook County, Illinois (i.e., Chicago area), and 52% of respondents in New York City live in multifamily housing.\\n\\n\\nParity in EV Charging Infrastructure Availability?\\n\\n\\nOur \\nEVForward™ study of the next generation of EV buyers\\n has shown how important home charging is to the EV experience—existing EV owners charge at home more than 80% of the time, while EV Intenders anticipate doing 75% of their charging at home. Single-family homeowners’ parking characteristics are well-suited for charging at home—82% park in their garage or driveway and 48% have access to a standard electrical outlet near where they park.\\n\\n\\nMultifamily housing residents’ parking characteristics are markedly different, with parking lot/garage and on-street parking much more the norm:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to not having driveway or garage parking, more than half of apartment dwellers and one-third of condo dwellers do not have a dedicated parking spot for themselves. Compounding this, only 30% of condo dwellers and 15% of apartment dwellers have access to a standard electrical outlet near where they park.\\n\\n\\nAccess to standard household outlets is problematic for multifamily housing charging, as these outlets only provide roughly three miles of range per hour of charging, which inadequately covers many drivers’ daily driving habits. However, the picture looks better for people who live in multifamily housing when considering access to Level 2 (L2) charging (which provides around 30 miles of range per hour of charging). Approximately 15% of all car buyers report access to L2 charging regardless of where they live. Additionally, apartment and condo dwellers are twice as likely as single-family housing dwellers to have a DC fast charger (which can add upward of 400 miles of range in an hour) available where they park.\\n\\n\\nAs another charging option, 15% of multifamily housing residents say they could walk to and from a location with a household outlet to charge their vehicle and 13% have a Level 2 charger within walking distance. These residents indicate a strong willingness to do this, with a majority (65%) saying they would likely charge someplace within walking distance to their home. However, 43% of multifamily housing residents report they don’t have any electricity charging source within walking distance.\\n\\n\\nThe Impact of EV Charging Infrastructure on EV Ownership and Intent\\n\\n\\nWhile many EV stakeholders believe that multifamily housing residents aren’t currently buying EVs, and thus solving multifamily housing charging is a future issue, we found that people who live in single-family homes, apartments and condos are equally likely to own an EV or plug-in hybrid. Clearly, any challenges multifamily housing residents have with charging an EV are not insurmountable barriers.\\n\\n\\nThere is a strong correlation between noticing charging infrastructure day-to-day and the perceived practicality of owning an EV. Multifamily housing dwellers are more likely than their counterparts in single-family homes to notice charging infrastructure and/or signage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is reflected in perceived EV practicality: overall, apartment and condo dwellers rate EV practicality at 44 on a 0-to-100 scale, while single-family housing dwellers score EV practicality at 42. The likelihood of considering an EV is similarly higher among multifamily housing dwellers than it is among dwellers of single-family homes.\\n\\n\\nA Disconnect Between Landlords and Tenants on EV Charging?\\n\\n\\nWe found that more than half of multifamily housing landlords will likely install EV charging at their properties in the next three years. However, there’s no clear alignment around how they anticipate providing charging—landlords are as likely to install standard household outlets for EV charging as they are to install dedicated full-power L2 chargers.\\n\\n\\nOne-third of multifamily housing residents say the availability of EV charging will be important in choosing where to live when they next move. However, EV charging availability becomes vastly more important for car buyers who say their next vehicle will be an EV, with 77% saying it will be important in their housing choice. These residents say that a dedicated L2 charger for every EV is most appealing to them, followed by having a dedicated household outlet for EV charging.\\n\\n\\nWhile there is broad consensus between multifamily housing landlords and tenants on household outlets and L2 chargers, many landlords say they’re likely to install L2 charging with power sharing (i.e., if multiple EVs are plugged in, then the charge rate is dynamically lowered). Tenants, however, find this charging style the least appealing. This may present a problem if tenants find power sharing untenable when owning an EV.\\n\\n\\nTwo Important Lessons on EV Charging Infrastructure for Multifamily Housing EV Owners\\n\\n\\nBased on these findings, solving charging for multifamily housing EV owners is not the barrier that many stakeholders believe it is.\\n\\n\\nHowever, it’s also not a fully solved problem and will require further attention from automakers, utilities and policymakers to ensure that multifamily housing residents can participate in and benefit from the e-mobility transition. In this vein, we can learn two main lessons from these findings:\\n\\n\\nLesson 1:\\n Continuing to invest in public infrastructure is essential. But it’s not enough to have the infrastructure in place if it’s not visible. Anyone installing charging infrastructure needs to ensure that it’s placed in a visible location and that it has eye-catching branding—avoid the “beige box!” Public infrastructure gives car buyers, regardless of where they live, confidence that they can get a charge when they need it and may play a crucial role in how multifamily housing residents charge.\\n\\n\\nLesson 2:\\n Landlords face a balancing act in installing infrastructure for their residents. Tenants who own an EV want a dedicated place to plug in their vehicle, but provisioning dedicated plugs in large parking lots or garages is expensive and risks incurring significant demand charges from the electric utility. Landlords will need to develop phasing plans that allow them to build infrastructure as EV ownership among their tenants grows organically and these plans should include discussion with their utility about ensuring sufficient electric charging capability.\\n\\n\\nFor more details on how multifamily housing residents and their landlords are thinking about EV charging, click below to discover more about our \\nEVs for EVeryone\\n report.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout the EVs for EVeryone Study\\n\\n\\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of 15,553 consumers age 18 to 99 between June 23 and August 24, 2023.

Federal electric vehicle policy has included equity components, such as a $4,000 tax credit for eligible used BEVs and clear statements about equity considerations in the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to increase inclusion:\\n\\n\\n“Plans should be developed through engagement with rural, underserved, and disadvantaged communities to ensure that diverse views are heard and considered throughout the planning process, and to ensure that the deployment, installation, operation, and use of EV charging infrastructure achieves equitable and fair distribution of benefits and services.” — \\nFederal Highway Administration NEVI guidance\\n\\n\\nHowever, consideration for equity and the impact of used BEVs extend beyond the federal government. Many utilities have centered equity in their BEV programs, led by municipal utilities seeking to support their local community’s equity goals. For example, municipally owned Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) offers a $1,500 rebate on purchases of a used BEV, with an additional $1,000 available for low-income customers.\\n\\n\\nBEVs have clear benefits for populations negatively impacted by systemic inequities, including helping improve local air quality and reducing the cost of transportation for owners through lower “fueling” and maintenance costs. However, we know from our \\nEVForward™ study on the next generation of EV buyers\\n that there are notable barriers to purchasing a BEV for new car buyers. While it’s safe to assume that similar barriers are present for used BEV buyers, nobody has studied this challenge—until now.\\n\\n\\nConsumer Sentiment on Buying a Used BEV\\n\\n\\nOur new \\nEVs for EVeryone\\n\\xa0report has found that 40% of consumers would consider a used vehicle the next time they shop for a car. Although the \\naverage new car currently sells for approximately $48,000\\n, we have found that 82% of consumers expect to spend less than that amount and 43% of them are open to considering a used vehicle the next time they shop.\\n\\n\\nAmong buyers considering a used vehicle, 18% are likely to consider a used BEV, with a further 26% on the fence about BEV consideration. However, used car buyers indicate that they find used BEVs a riskier proposition than used internal combustion engine vehicles—59% of used vehicle considerers and 36% of used BEV considerers think buying a used BEV is risky.\\n\\n\\nNew and used vehicle buyers generally align on the most important attributes (purchase price, quality/reliability/durability, and safety) of and concerns about BEVs. However, used car buyers are a bit more concerned about charge time and access to public charging infrastructure—as well as battery degradation, which isn’t a concern about new BEVs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn short, used car buyers are looking for assurances that a BEV will fit into their lives but also need to avoid getting into a situation where they’re forced into a financially untenable battery replacement down the road. Because of this, offering extended battery and vehicle warranties has the most significant positive impact on consumers considering a used BEV.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a result, purchase incentives such as those offered by the federal government and some utilities are insufficient to get buyers into used BEVs. To provide sufficient purchase incentives, the federal government and utilities need to work with automakers and third-party insurers to guarantee that shoppers won’t be stuck with expensive battery repair and replacement bills if they buy a BEV.\\n\\n\\nEncouraging Used BEV Adoption to Aid the Clean Energy Transition\\n\\n\\nTo foster an equitable clean energy transition and extend BEV adoption into customer groups that can’t afford a new vehicle, automakers and utilities need to consider how all consumers, including populations negatively impacted by systemic inequities, can feasibly adapt their lifestyle to a fully electrified vehicle. Although our findings show that barriers to adoption are similar for new and used BEVs, there are different, important implications for these populations that BEV industry stakeholders need to address for greater impact.\\n\\n\\nEscalent is at the \\nforefront of helping our clients understand underrepresented audiences\\n.

As Europe’s premier automotive and mobility event, IAA Mobility telegraphs the future of the automotive industry. We identified three themes from this year’s show that will impact automakers, tech companies and consumers over the coming years.\\n\\n\\n1. The Growing Importance of the Automotive Ecosystem, But What About the Consumer?\\n\\n\\n“Ecosystem” was the watchword of the conference, an acknowledgment that cars must serve a broader context than just mobility. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs), for example, need to support the electric grid and the increasing amount of variable renewable generation on the grid. Connected vehicles need to \\nfit within consumers’ existing technology ecosystems\\n.\\n\\n\\nMany speakers indicated that this increasing focus on an automotive ecosystem would put consumers at the center of what ecosystem partners do. For instance, Mate Rimac, CEO of Rimac Automobili, spoke of an “ecosystem, thinking about users, not owners.” Similarly, Richard Bouveret, CEO of Blue Solutions, discussed how battery electric vehicles need to exist within a broader energy ecosystem.\\n\\n\\nHowever, despite promises of consumer-centricity, speakers couldn’t define precisely what being consumer-centric meant within the context of the automotive ecosystem. Only one panel on how data inform a “next-level user experience” in purchasing a car acknowledged that their organizations struggled to get direct consumer feedback. This is ironic because it is only by obtaining direct consumer feedback that organizations can aspire to develop better products, services and user experiences.\\n\\n\\nFor whatever broader ecosystem vehicles must serve moving forward, consumers must be at the center of it and involved so industry players can take into account their opinions, desires and emotions when designing or enhancing products and services. Consumer voices help companies identify unmet needs, refine feature sets and craft winning go-to-market strategies. Whether with quantitative or qualitative research, hearing from consumers is what sets great companies—and stellar products and services—apart from merely good ones.\\n\\n\\nIf your organization needs help going from the theory of consumer-centricity to how to put it into practice, Escalent can help. We have decades of experience helping our \\nautomotive and mobility\\n, \\nenergy\\n and \\ntechnology\\n clients understand consumer needs and translate them into winning products.\\n\\n\\nFor instance, our \\nEVForward™ study of the next generation of BEV buyers\\n explores how to create a compelling consumer value proposition for grid-interactive electric vehicles to overcome significant consumer concerns about the impact of vehicle-to-grid on expensive vehicle batteries.\\n\\n\\n2. Software Eats the Auto World\\n\\n\\nTechnology companies such as Qualcomm, Google, Meta, Amazon and TikTok had starring roles at the conference, occupying prime main stage time slots. Befitting the ecosystem theme, these companies emphasized cross-industry collaboration while simultaneously demonstrating a desire to have a much more significant influence on the automotive industry than has historically been the case. In return, automotive brands seemed more ready than they have ever been to enlist support from technology companies as automakers have realized that their in-house expertise is not sufficient to address consumers’ mushrooming tech needs and sophistication.\\n\\n\\nTech companies presented automotive and mobility solutions that spanned from “back of house” to “front of house.” Meta pitched the metaverse as an environment for virtual vehicle development, while Amazon talked about how Amazon Web Services could facilitate virtual testing, accelerating development cycles that previously required real-world experience.\\n\\n\\nAutomotive supplier Continental discussed the future of the software-defined vehicle (SDV), which essentially amounts to an architectural change to centralized vehicle computing rather than distributed control modules across vehicle systems. This was clarifying because while SDV has the potential to create value for end consumers, it doesn’t inherently do so. Automakers and suppliers that don’t use the transition to SDV to differentiate themselves to consumers will miss an opportunity to carve out a competitive advantage.\\n\\n\\nConversely, Google and Qualcomm shared their vision of how connected vehicle solutions will impact consumers. Google’s offerings (Android Auto, Android Automotive OS and Google Automotive Services) accelerate vehicle software development cycle timelines while providing consumers access to services and apps such as Google Maps that they use in non-automotive contexts. Qualcomm discussed how its Snapdragon Digital Chassis can enable in-vehicle connected services such as a “digital concierge” that could suggest context-relevant information and handle tasks such as ordering groceries.\\n\\n\\nFor automakers looking to generate new revenue from connected vehicle services, a partnership with one or more tech companies may make good sense from a development standpoint. We’ve also found that consumers welcome these partnerships, with a recent EVForward™ study showing how \\nauto-tech partnerships can accelerate BEV adoption\\n.\\n\\n\\n3. The Chinese Are Coming, and What It Means for BEV Adoption\\n\\n\\nMany traditional automotive brands were conspicuous by their absence at IAA Mobility, including Ford, Audi and the Stellantis brands (except for a token effort by Opel). Of the automakers that were present, Chinese brands occupied at least twice the floor space as the other brands combined.\\n\\n\\nThe Chinese presence was led by BYD, which introduced its Seal compact luxury BEV, a direct competitor to the Tesla Model 3. Other Chinese brands represented included Seres Group, Dongfeng, Leapmotor, XEV and MG Motor (a British brand owned by Chinese conglomerate SAIC). Geely-owned brands Zeekr and Polestar also had cameos at supplier booths. Across these brands, every vehicle shown was a BEV and pricing was highly competitive, not just with American and European BEVs but also with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.\\n\\n\\nDuring my presentation at IAA Mobility, I shared data from the latest EVForward Europe study that show how BEV sales in the EU and UK are stalling due, in part, to the transition between “early adopter” customers who were willing to pay more for a BEV and “early mainstream” consumers who aren’t.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s EV expert K.C. Boyce shares insights on the characteristics, motivations and emotions of the EV buyer personas identified by our EVForward Europe study on the next generation of EV buyers in the EU and UK at the IAA Mobility 2023 conference.\\n\\n\\nThis is concerning for automakers that are relying on volume sales to mainstream consumers to provide a return on their significant investment in electrified powertrains. The result of this market shift and the lower price point that Chinese automakers are coming to market with is that Chinese brands are poised to gain significant market share in Europe, thereby helping Europe meet its policy goals around e-mobility. After Europe, the Chinese will come to the US with the tried and tested strategies that work best. If US automakers aren’t keeping an eye on China, they should be.\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to learn more about the latest findings from our EVForward Europe study, please click the button below to watch K.C.’s 15-minute presentation at IAA Mobility.'}\n","{'Index': 19, 'Heading': 'Strategic Partnerships Could Help Automakers Gain Ground in Maturing BEV Market', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/strategic-partnerships-could-help-automakers-gain-ground-in-maturing-bev-market/', 'Content': 'Consumers are increasingly familiar with battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and as more vehicle buyers turn their attention to electric models, brands are jockeying for market share. At the same time, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) brands are increasingly looking outside of traditional suppliers to help build a compelling BEV “ecosystem,” partnering with charge network operators and tech companies to fill capability gaps.\\n\\n\\nSince Escalent’s first \\nEVForward™\\n Brand DeepDive study in 2021, the BEV industry has matured. Legacy automotive brands have solidified their electric vehicle (EV) lineups. Meanwhile, EV specialists such as Polestar and Lucid are no longer considered newcomers to the space.\\n\\n\\nThe 2023 EVForward™ Brand DeepDive provides an updated look at the evolving BEV market. The study examines new-vehicle buyer attitudes toward 52 automotive, 12 public charging and 11 technology companies. In doing so, we explore how the next generation of EV buyers perceive automotive, charge network and technology brands—and how those perceptions interact to influence BEV purchase consideration.\\n\\n\\nEstablished Automakers Prevail—For Now\\n\\n\\nAs electric powertrains become more prevalent, awareness of BEV brands and models is rising. For now, though, legacy automotive brands and Tesla still have the edge in consumer mindshare. Familiarity with established automakers such as Ford, Toyota, BMW and Mercedes-Benz is at almost 100%. Tesla is the only EV specialist brand to be in the same ballpark, at 98% familiarity, with other startup EV specialist brands scoring below 60% for brand familiarity.\\n\\n\\nThat said, brand familiarity is only part of the picture. To successfully market their products, manufacturers need consumers to be conscious of their BEV-specific offerings. In this regard, EV specialists have an advantage. Tesla, Lucid, Rivian and NIO net the highest scores for recognition of BEV offerings.\\n\\n\\nDrivers consider quality and dependability to be among the most important vehicle attributes. As a result, legacy auto brands with proven track records trend toward the top of BEV purchase consideration lists. Tesla is the only EV specialist to make the top 10 for consideration and opinion ratings. However, as EV specialist brands solidify their position in the market, we can expect legacy auto brands to face elevated levels of competition.\\n\\n\\nA Shift in Consumer Sentiment Toward Tesla\\n\\n\\nTesla has long enjoyed a significant mindshare among consumers, and that remains the case. Once an outsider, the brand has become a formidable rival for legacy and EV specialist brands. Tesla is neck and neck with legacy automakers for brand familiarity, and consumer consideration is high. This is especially true for EV Intenders—consumers who are most likely to purchase a BEV as their next car.\\n\\n\\nDespite this, consumers have mixed sentiments about the Tesla brand. Approximately one in four new vehicle-buyers feels the company is moving in a negative direction. The brand has received substantial media attention in recent years, and not always for the better. Consumer reactions suggest that this exposure could be hurting rather than helping Tesla’s image—positioning other automakers to muscle in on Tesla’s market share.\\n\\n\\nPower in Automaker and Charge Point Operator Partnerships\\n\\n\\nAccess to charging remains a key concern for prospective BEV buyers. While national infrastructure is expanding, many drivers harbor concerns about how they will charge when they are away from home. Cross-industry partnerships between automakers and public charging providers could assuage some of these anxieties.\\n\\n\\nOur research has found that partnerships between public charging providers and OEMs positively impact BEV purchase consideration among new-car buyers. When new-vehicle buyers are told that the automaker they favor is teaming up with a charge point operator (CPO), their consideration of a BEV from that automaker rises. Among the top-five-performing CPOs, BEV consideration increases an average of 29%. This increase is even more marked among EV Intenders.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis points to a potential win for OEMs, which stand to boost sales by partnering with a CPO. It could also allow CPOs—which suffer from extremely limited brand awareness—to tap into the recognition that established automakers enjoy.\\n\\n\\nTechnology Is a Differentiator\\n\\n\\nWith technology serving as an important motivation for a BEV purchase, our findings suggest that partnering with a technology brand such as Intel, Apple or Microsoft could also positively influence BEV purchase consideration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCar owners rate “innovative features and technology” as an important attribute in a BEV, ranking fourth most important among luxury car owners and seventh most important among mainstream car owners. By aligning themselves with a recognized technology company, OEMs could improve perceptions around their capacity for innovation. This could be particularly effective for legacy brands, which underperform in this area. OEMs such as Volvo and GM have already begun working with Google to provide infotainment and connectivity functions.\\n\\n\\nHowever, while strategic partnerships with technology brands could enable OEMs to attract new customers and augment core BEV attributes, automakers should proceed with caution. For the majority of technology brands tested, new vehicle-buyers indicate a net positive impact on BEV purchase consideration. Uber and Facebook, on the other hand, score net negatives. As such, brands considering who to partner with should pay close attention to consumer sentiment.\\n\\n\\nA Turning Point\\n\\n\\nIt is a critical moment for BEV manufacturers. The shift to EVs is well underway, buoyed by commitments from OEMs to go all-electric in the coming years.\\n\\n\\nDuring this transitional period, legacy brands will need to work hard to maintain their standing in the industry. They may have the benefit of consumer trust and loyalty, but our data show that, when it comes to awareness of BEV offerings, EV specialists often outpace legacy automakers. As familiarity with BEV offerings grows, legacy brands will have to compete not just with Tesla but with a wide variety of EV specialists.\\n\\n\\nAutomotive partnerships with CPOs and technology brands could drive affinity and consideration among new customers by improving perceptions around charging and in-vehicle technology. Today, legacy auto brands have a significant level of market share. To preserve that lead, they will need to go all-in on innovation.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more?

As automakers look to continue this sales momentum to meet government mandates and help their investments in BEVs pay off, connected vehicle technology is emerging as a key selling point for shoppers.\\n\\n\\nOur \\nEVForward™\\n program, representing the largest and most comprehensive study of the next generation of EV buyers, has found that technology is not only a key motivator for many consumer groups, but is also a way to overcome barriers to purchasing a BEV shared across consumer groups.\\n\\n\\nA Growing BEV Market\\n\\n\\nRising BEV sales can be attributed to several related factors. Our research shows having friends or family with a BEV can \\nsignificantly impact\\n whether drivers consider going electric. That’s good news for vehicle manufacturers, as exposure to BEVs is increasing. In 2023, 40% of respondents said they know at least a few people who drive a BEV, up from 34% in 2022.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, more consumers are getting hands-on experience with battery electric vehicles. One in ten new car buyers indicates they have driven a BEV, a two-percentage-point jump since 2022. A further 27% said they know the BEV powertrain technology well, a 13% year-over-year improvement.\\n\\n\\nPerceptions around BEV practicality are changing, too. In 2020, the average respondent gave BEVs a practicality score of 35 points out of 100. Over the last three years, that figure has increased by eight percentage points to 43 points out of 100. That shift largely reflects the vastly expanded charging infrastructure built since 2020. The increased prevalence of charging has registered with buyers, as nearly one-third indicate awareness of BEV charging infrastructure, up six percentage points from 2022.\\n\\n\\nOur findings reveal a rapidly evolving market. \\nEV Intenders—those respondents identified by Escalent’s algorithms as more than 15 times more likely to purchase a BEV than the average shopper—currently constitute 25% of the new-car buyer marketplace, an increase from 21% in 2022.\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, the share of those in the EV Open category—those open to the concept but unlikely to actively shop for an EV—has fallen from 40% to 35%. Clearly, buyers are moving from a general willingness to consider BEVs to actively planning a BEV purchase.\\n\\n\\nTechnology-Oriented Shoppers\\n\\n\\nMany new-car buyers consider BEVs to have more-innovative technology than internal combustion vehicles. Accordingly, \\nmany expect BEV models to come with the latest in-vehicle technology, with these technology expectations serving as a buying motivation for several buyer personas.\\n\\n\\nAs the BEV market has matured, we took another look at buyer segments and whether they had changed since the inception of the EVForward study in 2020. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they had, with many consumers in the “innovator” and “early adopter” groups purchasing BEVs and evolving their motivations to stay with the powertrain. Our new Trailblazer persona, comprising 11% of the new-car market and having the highest likelihood to purchase a BEV of any persona, is a lover of new technology and is motivated to purchase a BEV by the connection between “innovative powertrain” and “innovative in-vehicle technology.”\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, our Techie and Dreamer segments, comprising 15% and 24% of the market, respectively, are motivated to purchase a BEV partly because of their love of technology. While Techies are driven almost entirely by technological motivations, Dreamers also want a vehicle that is fun to drive and that helps them stand out.\\n\\n\\nBeyond these specific segments, the value of connected services in a BEV is widely recognized—\\n44% of respondents said connected car technology would make life with a BEV more convenient.\\n\\n\\nMoreover, consumers increasingly deem connected vehicle features as necessities rather than optional add-ons. Nearly half of all participants reported that they regard connected car technology as a very important part of their next vehicle selection, with 41% saying they wouldn’t consider a BEV unless it had connected car technology.\\n\\n\\nAddressing BEV Range Anxiety\\n\\n\\nAlong with enhancing the driver experience, connected vehicle technology can help address key concerns among BEV shoppers, especially around range. Features such as range alerts, range estimators, battery diagnostics and charging finders could all ease anxiety around vehicle range, battery life and access to public charging.\\n\\n\\nBased on our data, consumer priorities broadly echo this. The top five must-have connected features in a BEV among EV Intenders, posting north of 70% apiece, are battery level status, battery health monitoring/diagnostics, alerts when vehicle range falls below a certain level, a range estimator based on real-time conditions, and a power-saving mode.\\n\\n\\nIn some cases, respondents indicated they would be willing to pay extra for these essential features. However, many EV shoppers already feel they are paying a premium for battery electric powertrains, and automakers will need to balance the advantages of charging extra for these features with the implicit expectation that BEVs come equipped with the latest and greatest technology.\\n\\n\\nThe Potential of Connected Services in BEVs\\n\\n\\nIn addition to connected vehicle technologies being a way to address key BEV purchase barriers, our research also indicates that EV Intenders are more likely to buy in—literally and figuratively—to a connected vehicle ecosystem. EV Intenders indicate a higher willingness to pay for features that make life with a BEV easier, and more than three-quarters are likely to download apps to their vehicle, assuming they were available.\\n\\n\\nThese findings indicate a path forward for automakers struggling to meet BEV mandates and figure out a scalable business model around connected vehicles. As the volume of people shopping for and buying BEVs climbs, our research indicates the factors influencing their purchase will shift. State-of-the-art in-vehicle technology is becoming a primary motivator among future EV drivers and a way that automakers can capture increasing consumer interest in BEVs. And these buyers are more likely to subscribe to connected services.\\n In a nice synergy, connected vehicles get more buyers in BEVs and more BEVs get more subscribers to connected services.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more?

It is the transition into this latter group that may make the prospect of return on investment (ROI) appear on the horizon for automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\\n\\n\\nBut how quickly will that ROI come into view if the most progressive customer groups on the EV adoption curve are not unconditional advocates?\\n\\n\\nIn 2022, Escalent’s second annual \\nEVForward\\nTM\\n Europe study revealed more than one-third of current EV owners do not necessarily see themselves buying another EV as a replacement. Of these unsure owners, 40% viewed EVs as still being a work in progress while a further 12% thought EVs are a passing fad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis feels like an extraordinary dynamic among consumers most open to new ideas.\\n\\n\\nSurveying more than 10,000 new-car buyers across the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, EVForward Europe also shows that more new-car buyers know someone who owns an EV than in 2021—what happens if less-than-enthusiastic EV owners spread the word among their peer group? Does the tricky-to-sell-to Early Majority become even more difficult to reach?\\n\\n\\nThis blog aims to consider what forms of varied support may be needed to make the prospect of EV adoption look more reassuring and rewarding—in other words, how OEMs and EV stakeholders can create an “EV easy” mindset among consumers.\\n\\n\\nFour Areas of Focus to Make EV Adoption and Ownership Easier\\n\\n\\n1. The Nature of EV Journeys\\n\\n\\nOne of the first things to address is the nature of journeys taken by our less enthusiastic EV owners. If anything, this less enthusiastic group works their vehicles less than EV-positive owners by taking shorter commutes and fewer longer journeys. Thus, EVs can realistically fit their range needs.\\n\\n\\nHowever, we continue to see that car shoppers’ emotions can inflate perceived range needs to unrealistic levels. Therefore, it is critical for automakers and EV stakeholders to educate and reassure new-car shoppers about the reality of managing EV journeys.\\n\\n\\n2. Resources for EV Charging\\n\\n\\nAccording to our findings, most new-car buyers would prefer home charging to be a large part of their charging behavior. However, the type of home property and surrounding environment can make home or public charging more or less challenging.\\n\\n\\nEV providers and stakeholders need to ask themselves:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAre EV owners provided with sufficient resources and support to solve their charging problems?\\n\\n\\nIf not, what can we do to solve this?\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, what would make a public charging site more accessible, desirable and comfortable?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEVForward Europe does indicate that although home parking characteristics are similar across both groups of owners, there are some differences in the charging equipment used. Greater dependency on regular 240V plug sockets serves to limit the amount of charge that can be taken on—potentially imposing stresses on and disruptions to owners’ regular daily schedule.\\n\\n\\nIn scenarios where private wall box charging installation is impractical, what kind of support can be offered to create practical charging strategies for EV owners? This has implications for both customer relationship management and onboard software.\\n\\n\\n3. EV Buyer Motivations and Ownership Experience\\n\\n\\nEVForward Europe has identified six persona groups of future EV buyers in Europe that have diverse perspectives on electric vehicles. Three of those groups view EVs positively but have distinctly different motivations when it comes to EV adoption.\\n\\n\\nIrrespective of whether entry into the EV world is triggered by an appetite for technology, social responsibility or other motivations, it is important that the different personal rewards offered by EV ownership correspond with the advantages future EV buyers anticipate. To do so will take a deep understanding of the different EV buyer personas.\\n\\n\\n4. Mental and Emotional EV Drivers\\n\\n\\nIt is also evident that new-car buyers have very different emotional relationships with their vehicles—EV owners are no different.\\n\\n\\nRelationships can vary from considering a vehicle as a “Personal Assistant/Secretary” (that provides efficient, rational support) to an “Evil Twin” (whose focus is on the fun side of life) and even a “Lover” (which reflects an intense and passionate interaction). Much can be done in design—regarding aesthetic and human machine interface—to ensure an owner recognizes the role play signal they want from their car.\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, there is no doubt that owning an EV requires a significant amount of mental rewiring to accommodate different behaviors and considerations.\\n\\n\\nSome people relish a challenge, thinking along the lines of \\n“show me an obstacle and I will find a way over it, under it or around it.\\n”\\n\\n\\nFor others, obstacles provoke stress, inducing thoughts and feelings of doubt, such as “\\nthere’s an obstacle in my way\\n—\\nperhaps I shouldn’t have chosen this route.”\\n\\n\\nAll these complex emotional interactions point to a need for astute support that reaches far beyond point-of-sale reassurances. The kind of support required by the person who has a sleepless night worrying about how to manage their 200-mile journey the next morning is different from the carpe diem mindset.\\n\\n\\nDelivering Multifaceted EV Support\\n\\n\\nThe critical support—via technology and traditional mediums—offered to EV buyers needs to become a multifaceted eco-structure that offers options for different consumer mindsets in different circumstances, so the EV user experience makes ownership \\n“EV easy!”\\n\\n\\nWe designed our EVForward Europe 2023 study, which is currently in field, to provide even deeper diagnostic perspective on both the user experience among EV owners as well as future EV adoption trends and desires.\\n\\n\\nIf you’re interested in learning more about our EVForward Europe findings and how we can help you refine your EV strategy, please reach out to us by clicking the button below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout EVForward™ Europe 2022\\n\\n\\nThe second annual wave of the EVForward Europe study was conducted across five European countries: United Kingdom (n=1,941), Germany (n=2,011), France (n=1,723), Italy (n=1,915) and Spain (n=1,806). It had a market-representative sample of 9,396 respondents and included a survey that fielded from July to August 2022. Respondents were ages 18 to 80 with a primary vehicle model that’s 2016 or newer, and all intended to purchase a new vehicle within the next five years.\\xa0Data were weighted by age and gender to match the demographics of the new-vehicle buyer population and by vehicle segment to match current vehicle sales.

That’s according to research from Escalent’s \\nFleet Advisory Hub™\\n. This leading insights program is designed to assess the needs, expectations and emotions of commercial vehicle and fleet decision-makers.\\n\\n\\nThe Fleet Technology Index (FTI) report, the flagship annual study from the Fleet Advisory Hub program, synthesizes feedback from 1,000 fleet decision-makers to assess perceptions of and market readiness for eight core and emerging technologies slated to disrupt the \\ncommercial vehicle and fleet industry\\n. Based on participants’ responses and advanced data analytics, technologies are assigned an FTI score, with higher scores indicating a stronger likelihood of adoption.\\n\\n\\nFleet Businesses Shifting to Growth Mode\\n\\n\\nIn the wake of pandemic-induced challenges, supply chain constraints and economic uncertainty, many fleet companies were in survival mode. Now, the latest data suggest that businesses are shifting back to growth—and are eager to pick up the pace.\\n\\n\\nFrom 2020 to 2023, there was an overall 27% increase in Escalent’s FTI score. While the majority of the technologies represented in the study are in the early stages of adoption, this trend demonstrates a mounting recognition of the value of fleet technologies and a promising movement toward market readiness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe FTI score for core technologies—data analytics, telematics, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs)—has climbed by 33% since 2020. Meanwhile, the index score for emerging technologies—artificial intelligence (AI), drones, mobility services and blockchain—has risen by 16%.\\n\\n\\nAutonomous Vehicles Taking a Back Seat\\n\\n\\nDespite this positive trajectory, not all technologies are faring equally. The appetite for AVs appears to have plateaued. Many fleet decision-makers have expressed trepidation about vehicle autonomy. One-quarter acknowledged AV technology has a role to play in certain situations, but almost one-half said the technology needs to be proven in real-world scenarios to earn their confidence.\\n\\n\\nThe lack of receptiveness may be partly due to a pullback on the industry side—a result of necessary prioritization among vehicle manufacturers and service providers to focus on alternative powertrains and connected vehicle services. Although it is widely accepted that electrification and autonomy will go hand in hand, until automakers and the market at large realize the full potential of BEVs, AV technology will likely lag.\\n\\n\\nThat said, some stepping stones to autonomy, such as advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) features, have already broken into the market—an indication the industry continues to inch toward broader application of AVs.\\n\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence Awareness Spiking\\n\\n\\nAV technology may be stalling, but enthusiasm for AI is on the rise. AI’s index score has increased by 24% since 2020—placing the technology ahead of AVs. Additionally, the business intention to invest has risen by 39% compared with 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rapid rise to prominence of ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies has ushered in an influx of commentary and coverage in the media. Awareness of its potential is growing, and across industry verticals, fleet decision-makers are thinking about how AI-enabled tools could benefit their bottom line.\\n\\n\\nDrone technology is also pulling ahead. Adoption of drones is up 50% and drone technology has the second highest FTI score among emerging technologies.\\n\\n\\nAlthough these tools are still evolving, businesses expect emerging technologies to be used in their operations relatively soon—anticipating that AI would be integrated into operations within 4.5 years, with average estimates for the adoption of drones, mobility services and blockchain falling within a 5- to 6-year window.\\n\\n\\nCore Technologies Lead the Way\\n\\n\\nEmerging technologies may be gaining ground, but three core technologies—data analytics, telematics and BEVs—remain at the forefront.\\n\\n\\nSince 2020, the FTI scores for telematics and data analytics have risen by 50% and 28%, respectively. In the last year, adoption of data analytics has grown by 53%, with telematics just behind at 44%. Fleet companies are mobilizing for a data-driven, connected future. Increasingly, the question is when, not if, these tools become commonplace within the business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBEVs also perform well in this year’s study. The BEV index score has increased 32% since 2020 thanks in part to evolving regulations and a heavy marketing emphasis in the industry around the transition to zero-emission fleets. Additionally, the recent California Air Resources Board \\nAdvanced Clean Fleets ruling\\n will continue pushing fleet electrification. Since 2022, adoption has climbed by 54%, although fleets eyeing electrification \\nstill face considerable challenges\\n.\\n\\n\\nThe Year of the Rebound\\n\\n\\nIt may be decades before fleet technologies fully infiltrate the mainstream market. However, fleet decision-makers continue progressing along the adoption curve. The number of fleet companies pilot testing and integrating core technologies is climbing. In 2023, half of survey participants have reported their company had shopped for a BEV. And the portion of companies aborting technology integrations has decreased across all core technologies by 40% to 60%.\\n\\n\\nFrom a macro perspective, market conditions remain tough for fleets. In our 2022 \\nConnected Services report\\n, 37% of fleet decision-makers said they were “very concerned” about the possibility of a recession. Even so, companies understand the need to stay competitive in an increasingly technology-driven environment and are reinvesting resources in core and emerging technologies.\\n\\n\\nWhile hurdles still exist for fleet companies, many are embracing a forward-looking perspective when it comes to technology—marking 2023 as the year of the rebound.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to learn more about our Fleet Advisory Hub findings or how we can help you with your product and service development strategy to best meet the needs of fleet businesses, click the link below to contact us.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout Fleet Advisory Hub™\\n\\n\\nThe results reported come from our 2023 FTI report about the current state of market readiness for adoption of core and emerging technologies by commercial vehicle and fleet businesses, and comprise a subset of commercial vehicle and fleet decision-makers drawn from the Fleet Advisory Hub audience.

Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and technology companies are under mounting pressure to deploy products and services that deliver on the promise of vehicle connectivity while providing value and commercial opportunity.\\n\\n\\nHowever, without a comprehensive understanding of their target audience, automakers and technology providers struggle to pinpoint which connected vehicle solutions will appeal to future buyers.\\n\\n\\nWe designed our \\nConnectivity Forward™\\n study to bridge that gap and we uncovered a wealth of insights that illuminate the path forward for automotive and tech players to succeed in the connected vehicle market.\\n\\n\\nConsumers’ Technology Ecosystem\\n\\n\\nOn average, consumers spend only 5% of their time in their vehicles. \\nAs a result, consumers’ perspectives on in-vehicle technology are heavily influenced by the brands and devices they use when not driving.\\n Car owners increasingly see their vehicle as another “node” in their already established technology ecosystem. They want a smooth, simple and streamlined way for their vehicle to exist in concert with their extended network of digital applications and services.\\n\\n\\nWith the advent of 5G and the emergence of software-defined vehicles—which can be upgraded and enhanced throughout their lifetime with over-the-air updates—the world of connectivity is changing. By 2030, experts predict that connected vehicle services will have matured from a $60 billion to a $400 billion marketplace. There is a growing appetite for in-vehicle connected services and functions—and thousands of possible products. However, OEMs and tech providers hoping to tap into this space have competition.\\n\\n\\nConnected Vehicle Competition and Opportunity\\n\\n\\nMany consumers have already embraced connectivity solutions provided by third parties—namely, the tech brands they are already using every day. According to our findings, nearly half of Apple CarPlay (48%) and Android Auto (40%) users say they would not consider a vehicle that didn’t support this functionality in the future, and the majority of others (49% of Apple and 52% of Android users) would prefer to have it. This presents a challenge for OEMs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs more vehicle owners adopt third-party mirroring platforms, OEMs risk losing out on openings to create and market their own products. If automakers wish to develop services and features that add value rather than simply duplicate existing tech offerings, they need to understand which customers will invest in connected vehicle services and what those customers care about.\\n\\n\\nBy profiling thousands of individuals, Connectivity Forward identified the segment of vehicle owners that automotive and technology companies should tailor their ideation, offerings and marketing around. Tech-forward consumers who already buy connected services and subscriptions because they want to be tech leaders are the most likely to adapt to future connected vehicle services. However, according to our findings, approximately one-third of car owners sit within a larger target growth group that doesn’t just include tech-progressive people. These owners are less likely to be current vehicle connectivity service subscribers yet demonstrate openness to connected vehicle solutions. As such, they hold the greatest potential for new revenue.\\n\\n\\nConsumer Subscription Fatigue\\n\\n\\nSubscriptions have become an accepted part of daily life. We found that consumers have subscriptions in an average of four different categories. Most notably, 84% of study participants report having one or more entertainment subscriptions, and 72% a shopping subscription. In one sense, this is an encouraging trend. Consumers have embraced the subscription model, thus paving the way for its rollout in the automotive market.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, as the number of subscription services rises, consumers are exhibiting fatigue and frustration with recurring payments. This is particularly true for services that once may have only required a one-time purchase, as we learned from \\nBMW’s heated seat subscription\\n late last year. To overcome this, automotive and technology companies will need to clearly articulate how the movement toward subscription services will benefit the consumer.\\n\\n\\nAs it stands, the message does not seem to have landed. Across the industry, adoption of post-trial paid connected vehicle services remains low, with only 10%–20% of trials converting into ongoing subscriptions. The issue may not lie with the subscription form driving low adoption but, rather, from a lack of understanding from consumers as to \\nwhy\\n these services need to be subscriptions or, indeed, from a lack of intrinsic value in the subscription itself.\\n\\n\\nConsumers’ Data Anxiety\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOEMs and technology companies must also reckon with elevated awareness of and anxiety around data sharing and privacy. Consumers are sharing more data than ever. Many appreciate personalization and recognize that sharing their data improves the quality of subscription-based services. That said, this does not mean consumers are wholly comfortable with the trade-offs. 71% of respondents told Escalent they worry about the confidentiality of the information they share, with financial and security data topping the list of concerns.\\n\\n\\nWhat’s more, 58% of consumers concerned about data privacy believe the value of their data will increase over time. They are focused not just on protecting but possibly monetizing their data.\\n\\n\\nThis leaves OEMs and technology providers with a difficult line to tread. Connected services rely on the transfer of data. But, should data-reliant subscription features fail to meet security or performance expectations, users may be quick to block access or unsubscribe.\\n\\n\\nExpand Connected Vehicle Service Targets and Educate\\n\\n\\nThe rising interest in connected services represents a significant opportunity for OEMs and tech players to integrate connected features and functionality into vehicles. But there are still hurdles to overcome. Consumers are uneasy about data sharing and privacy. Some are experiencing subscription fatigue. And many do not yet see the value of the subscription-based model for vehicle services.\\n\\n\\nTo address this, OEMs and technology providers must deploy products and services that excite consumers and enhance the in-vehicle experience. OEMs will also need to better articulate the benefits of these offerings and, more broadly, the subscription model to consumers. This includes how and why services and features will use ongoing data to perform.\\n\\n\\nAutomakers, in particular, can no longer afford to treat connected vehicle services as an afterthought. If OEMs wish to realize the promise of vehicle connectivity alongside tech brands, they must reflect on how they can provide new vehicle tech and subscriptions that fit into consumers’ personal tech ecosystems and deliver value. Meanwhile, tech players can create value-added vehicle ownership and user experiences by collaborating with automakers to deliver mutually beneficial connected vehicle services. For all players involved, doing so will require specific and deep knowledge of the attitudes and expectations of tomorrow’s connected vehicle service users.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about our Connectivity Forward study findings and how we can support you with your connected vehicle product and service strategy, click the button below to send us a note.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout Connectivity Forward™\\n\\n\\nEscalent conducted a survey of 4,726 US vehicle owners by online data collection from July 28 to September 18, 2022.

The average age of a light-duty truck is also up by three years, averaging \\n11.6 years\\n in operation.\\n\\n\\nBased on an ongoing Escalent study exploring attitudes and behaviors of vehicle owners and intenders, there are several indicators that the upward trajectory in vehicle age may continue. This suggests there is significant potential for automotive dealers to lean into maintenance and repair offerings that can extend vehicle life spans, thereby further building a positive vehicle ownership experience and relationship with customers.\\n\\n\\nFour Key Factors Driving Vehicle Age\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncreasing Concern About Financial Future:\\n According to our study, more than half of consumers are less optimistic about the direction the United States is heading compared to a year ago, which is up from about one-third in 2019. Furthermore, more than one-quarter are less confident in maintaining their household income also compared to a year ago—up from 13% in 2019.\\n\\n\\nRising Vehicle Costs:\\n One-third of consumers who do not plan to acquire a vehicle in the next 12 months say they cannot afford to acquire a vehicle right now, and another one in seven says interest rates are too high. Meanwhile, new and used car prices are at record highs. Given the \\naverage sale price for a new car in December 2022\\n was $49,507—an almost 5% increase from the previous year—and the \\naverage used vehicle listing price\\n was $26,213 in March 2023, it is understandable that some consumers are not in a position to make such an investment in the short term. Furthermore, nearly two in ten survey respondents state that investing in a new vehicle is a poor value for the money right now.\\n\\n\\nChanging Vehicle Acquisition Plans:\\n With record-high transaction prices and an uncertain economy, almost three in ten vehicle intenders are postponing or abandoning their plans to acquire a vehicle.\\n\\n\\nMaintaining Current Vehicles:\\n Instead of trading up, drivers are seeking ways to keep their vehicles on the road. Almost four in ten owners of a 2013 or older vehicle prefer to keep their older-model vehicle. The majority of these owners find automotive parts and accessories an easy and affordable way to keep their vehicle feeling new, increase the resale value and enhance safety—thus prolonging the viability of the vehicle and keeping it in operation longer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpportunity for Dealers to Strengthen Customer Relationships\\n\\n\\nAlthough car sales may be slowing, this constellation of factors presents a tremendous opportunity for dealers to further strengthen the relationship with their customers and sustain a positive vehicle ownership experience by leveraging the service department as a relevant and frequent touch point.\\n\\n\\nService departments, traditionally, have not taken the lead with marketing and customer retention efforts. However, customers with a decade-plus aged vehicle will appreciate the proactive stance and commitment by dealers to help them preserve a vital asset, especially during volatile economic times.\\n\\n\\nThe vehicle aging trend also presents an opportunity for dealers to explore emerging business models such as car sharing and car subscriptions. These alternatives to vehicle ownership may be a perfect fit for a customer who has an older vehicle where investing in repairs no longer makes good financial sense. These new business models also offer a recurring revenue stream for the dealer, which can be a strong motivating factor for adoption.\\n\\n\\nSupporting Vehicle Owners and Nurturing Brand Loyalty\\n\\n\\nA lot has changed in the industry since 2000 when the average age of a vehicle was nine years and customer expectations were much more manageable.\\n\\n\\nIt is important for dealers to review customer engagement strategies targeted at older-vehicle owners to ensure messaging encompasses a transition from solely preventative maintenance to maintenance and repair-or-replace. By doing so, dealerships can continue nurturing a positive relationship with owners of older vehicles and strengthen brand loyalty.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about our findings or how we can help you best meet consumers’ needs, click the button below to send us a note.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout the Study\\n\\n\\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of 1,020 consumers ages 18 and older from March 2, 2023 to March 24, 2023.

On average, fleet companies use eight such services. However, integration between these products and services is proving elusive. That’s according to Escalent’s latest \\nFleet Advisory Hub™\\n report, which examines the state of connected services in fleet businesses and the overall ecosystem of connected fleet operations by going beyond take rates of vehicle telematics and vehicle-focused services.\\n\\n\\nThere are significant benefits to connecting a fleet business via smart technology. But connectivity also raises a challenge: how to combine data from disparate systems across the enterprise—not only connecting the vehicles.\\n\\n\\nConnected Fleet Tunnel Vision\\n\\n\\nDecision-makers value simplicity. Seventy-two percent told Escalent that integrating data across connected devices was important. Meanwhile, 66% said they wished to minimize service providers, highlighting a potential weakness in the deployment of multiple connectivity solutions among fleet businesses. Even where telematic solutions are implemented effectively, fleets may miss the opportunity to integrate telematics data with the rest of the business ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEducation could be the key. Currently, 46% of decision-makers say they primarily learn about connected services through internet searches. Only 23% cited their manufacturer fleet representative—and 21% their telematics services provider—as a primary source of knowledge.\\n\\n\\nIn a business built on relationships, service providers and vehicle manufacturers could be more involved in coaching fleet customers. In doing so, they would be better positioned to influence their customers’ path to purchase. These trusted advisors can ensure fleet decision-makers receive accurate and relevant information by inserting themselves into the learning journey. This can aid fleet decision-makers in “connecting the dots” across the broader enterprise.\\n\\n\\nOrganizational Fleet Business Complexity\\n\\n\\nFor fleets, convenience means ease of transaction and the ability to streamline solutions. That makes existing relationships and bundled or complementary systems particularly attractive.\\n\\n\\nTo illustrate with an example, many fleet decision-makers told Escalent they either opted for telematics providers they had an existing relationship with or with manufacturers that had a telematics solution packaged with their vehicles. This is reflected in the dominant service providers. Verizon Connect is the most frequently used provider, with 32% indicating they use the company for telematics. AT&T follows at 27%, with Ford Pro at 17%.\\n\\n\\nHowever, the collaborative nature of enterprise-level decision-making adds complexity to the sales process. Sixty-two percent of participants said their company solicits input beyond a solitary decision-maker.\\n\\n\\nThis creates a longer and more challenging cycle for sellers, who often need to convince multiple stakeholders that have different viewpoints and considerations. For example, representatives from human resources are likely to approach the process from a different perspective from those in fleet management.\\n\\n\\nProviders need to develop adaptable value propositions—and understand the business well enough to know who is responsible for the final decision.\\n\\n\\nIdentifying Connected Service Differentiators\\n\\n\\nThe technology used in connected services is evolving so quickly that it can be difficult for brands to do more than keep up. As a result, few have unique selling propositions across the competitive landscape.\\n\\n\\nWithout a clear understanding of how each connected service brand stands out, fleet decision-makers default to what they know. Two-thirds said personal experiences with technology or software somewhat influence their business decisions. Another 27% indicated they try to align personal and business technology as much as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond leaning on existing relationships, providers need to do more to differentiate themselves. This is particularly true for telematics providers.\\n\\n\\nWithin the telematic solutions market, most brands use similar messaging and benefits, ultimately creating an even more obscure decision for fleet leaders. This could explain why marketing efforts are doing little to sway fleet decision-makers to work with specific providers. As a result, cost and convenience are the key criteria used to select a telematics provider over solution-specific benefit statements. There’s an opportunity for a front-runner to emerge by clarifying its messaging to inspire a diverse group of stakeholders or by becoming more specialized in particular areas of telematics and connected solutions.\\n\\n\\nProtecting Fleet Business Assets and Privacy\\n\\n\\nPersonal experience with technology generates sales, but it also plays another role in business operations. One-third of companies using mobile phones and tablets said they allow employees to bring their own device to work. This poses a potential security threat to companies that are often unprepared for a data or security breach. Fewer than half of businesses use an antivirus or antispam service to protect workers’ devices, or even require employees to lock such devices with a password or similar mechanism.\\n\\n\\nDecision-makers agree that data privacy and security are essential. Despite this, many enterprises don’t have robust protections in place. This represents an additional chance for service providers to proactively participate in fleet customer education by helping to raise awareness and mitigate risk.\\n\\n\\nBeyond Singular Connected Fleet Solutions\\n\\n\\nDespite rapid technological advances, most fleet businesses are in the early stages of their digital transformation journeys. The lack of appropriate data protection is just one example of this. The sector is still grappling with integrating individual services across the broader business ecosystem.\\n\\n\\nSolution providers and vehicle manufacturers can play a role in bridging this gap. Many are eyeing opportunities to marry telematics to broader fleet management solutions through strategic partnerships or mergers. Others are already offering products that layer multiple connected services. Those who wish to differentiate themselves must keep pushing for greater connectivity—and find new ways to effectively communicate their benefits.\\n\\n\\nBy looking beyond singular solutions, service providers and vehicle manufacturers can become stronger trusted partners to fleet businesses, helping decision-makers prepare their companies—and not just vehicles—for a connected future.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to learn more about Fleet Advisory Hub, our findings and how we can help you refine your strategy and offerings to better meet the needs of fleet businesses, click the button below to send us a note.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Fleet Advisory Hub™\\n\\n\\nThe results reported come from our 2022 report on the ecosystem of connected commercial vehicle and fleet businesses and comprise a subset of commercial vehicle and fleet decision-makers drawn from the Fleet Advisory Hub audience.

Price, brand, size and capability continue to inform decisions. However, new factors, such as range and charge time, now also come into play.\\n\\n\\nBEVs have spurred a new approach to design, too. Manufacturers are increasingly opting for futuristic-looking exteriors, while interior design choices are moving toward open driver cockpits and high-tech touchscreens.\\n\\n\\nMarket research methodologies can assess the logical elements of vehicle buying—for instance, what functionality consumers value. Although designers and marketers intuitively know that design and emotional appeal drive consumer purchasing behavior, it has been difficult to quantitatively gauge how emotion informs the vehicle shopping process. This, in turn, has made it hard to know how consumers emotionally react to and rate design choices. Until now.\\n\\n\\nThe \\nEVForward™\\n 2022 Product DeepDive aims to solve that problem. Using Escalent’s proprietary, data-driven Evoke™ approach, \\nthis novel study\\n taps into respondents’ subconscious reactions to automotive design to understand what shoppers feel when they see a vehicle.\\n\\n\\nBEV Designs That Amaze\\n\\n\\nEmotion is challenging to measure. People are complicated and often struggle to verbalize how something makes them feel. To address this, Evoke™ uses quantitatively tested images linked to specific emotions, allowing brands to measure intuitive emotional reactions to a product.\\n\\n\\nWhen combined with consumer feedback on more logical differentiators, our data provide unprecedented insight into why drivers would or would not select a vehicle.\\n\\n\\nEmotion significantly influences consumers—particularly at the early stages of the purchase funnel. Escalent has found that exterior designs that elicit positive emotions generate stronger appeal and consideration. Designs that induce a sense of amazement leave the most powerful impression.\\n\\n\\nThe next generation of EV buyers—EV Intenders—are receptive to BEV exterior designs and react most positively. This group reacts more strongly with emotions of amazement, admiration, trust, anticipation and joy. It also has lower reactions of boredom and apprehension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAutomakers have long asked whether BEVs should have a different look from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Interestingly, participants were less concerned with whether a model looked like a BEV or ICE vehicle and instead valued exterior designs they considered exciting, strong, responsive and luxurious. Respondents also demonstrated less concern for whether a vehicle appeared futuristic. In fact, the lowest-ranked product in the study was the Tesla Cybertruck, which features a highly futuristic body design.\\n\\n\\nThe Price Dichotomy\\n\\n\\nDrivers love the look of luxury. Despite this, price is a leading factor in BEV consideration alongside body type and exterior design. As a result, while consumers appreciate a luxury feel and design, they are not necessarily willing to pay more to attain them. This leaves automakers with a fine line to walk between aesthetics and affordability.\\n\\n\\nFor automakers, homing in on what drivers care most about could help them telegraph luxury without the corresponding price tag. Consumers want attractive vehicles, but most are less invested in futuristic, BEV-specific designs. Knowing how drivers rank design elements can help manufacturers produce aesthetically pleasing vehicles without driving up costs.\\n\\n\\nA BEV-Specific Response\\n\\n\\nIn terms of broad appeal, no one brand dominates the market. Instead, consumers gravitate to specific models. Among vehicles that received above-average scores for appeal and consideration, a range of recognized automakers are represented, including Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Audi.\\n\\n\\nThat said, brand is still an important factor in purchase consideration. For each vehicle, participants first saw a de-badged photograph of the vehicle. After we evaluated their emotional reaction to the design and gauged how appealing they found it, participants were shown specifications, such as brand, model, range, charge time, battery warranty and cost. Only then did they rate their level of consideration.\\n\\n\\nEchoing \\nprevious EVForward findings\\n, electric vehicle (EV) start-ups such as Rivian, VinFast and Polestar fall behind legacy brands that have already earned customer trust. In addition, when asked what would prompt them to \\nnot\\n consider a vehicle, 28% cited brand.\\n\\n\\nNew BEV Design Flexibility\\n\\n\\nBEVs offer more flexibility in interior design than ICE vehicles—although that doesn’t mean that consumers are on board with what designers are doing with that flexibility. BEVs do not need a central tunnel, creating the opportunity for an open driver compartment with a diminished center console and no floor division. This provides additional space for infotainment screens, allowing automakers to put more emphasis on and functionality in touchscreens.\\n\\n\\nHowever, our data revealed differences in consumer attitudes toward interior design across demographics, signaling a need for caution among automakers experimenting with interior possibilities. When asked to choose between three cockpit layouts—closed, semi-enclosed and open—respondents more often selected the semi-enclosed design. Preferences varied across ages and genders. Those younger than 35 and females favored the closed compartment. Meanwhile, older age groups and males were drawn to the open compartment design.\\n\\n\\nOur findings indicate that whether the vehicle looks more like a BEV or ICE vehicle is much less important than other design attributes.\\n\\n\\nCapturing Broad BEV Appeal\\n\\n\\nNewer BEVs typically feature open interiors with a subdued center console and no floor division, but this doesn’t fully align with shopper preferences.\\n\\n\\nWhen asked about specific interior design elements, many participants indicated comfort with characteristics correlating to a traditional cockpit layout. 55% of respondents favored a prominent center console and 45% preferred a floor division. And although close to half of those surveyed wanted a touchscreen and a high-tech design, 28% opted for buttons.\\n\\n\\nThis reflects sentiments around vehicle exteriors. Consumers like sleek, cohesive designs. However, they are not necessarily seeking something cutting-edge. Rather than pursue a futuristic look, automakers may need to inch back their aesthetic to capture appeal from a wider group.\\n\\n\\nThe first generation of BEV buyers were trailblazers who craved the latest technology and a futuristic design that screamed “BEV.” As more drivers go electric, automakers should revisit assumptions about their target audience. Tomorrow’s BEV buyers have different preferences. Designing future BEVs that appeal to current owners may miss the mark for the tidal wave of BEV buyers on the horizon. While design innovation can allow brands to differentiate themselves in the market, they won’t be successful if they are not aligned with consumer preferences.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about these findings, EVForward in general, or how we can help you tailor your strategy to reach future EV buyers, click the button below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout the 2022 EVForward™ Product DeepDive\\n\\n\\nThis EVForward DeepDive was conducted among a national sample of 1,494 respondents—with 43 EV Owner, 269 EV Intender, 590 EV Open and 592 EV Resistant respondents as identified by Escalent’s algorithm—from October 27 to November 15, 2022.

In the second wave of our annual \\nEVForward\\nTM\\n Europe study that surveys 10,000+ new car buyers across the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, we found 29% are BEV Intenders—consumers who are 15 times more likely than the average new car buyer to shop for and purchase a BEV as their next vehicle. The European Parliament’s \\nrecently adopted law to eliminate tailpipe emissions by 2035\\n will only accelerate the transition to BEVs.\\n\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, it’s important for energy providers to understand how “fueling” will happen for new BEV owners and how energy providers can adapt their business in response.\\n\\n\\nBEV Home Charging Challenges and Opportunities\\n\\n\\n70% of buyers say they anticipate “all” or “most” of their charging will happen at home, but that figure disguises a significant 52% who say they’d do “most” of their charging at home—meaning there is opportunity outside of the home for energy providers to support these buyers.\\n\\n\\nDespite these expectations, home charging remains a barrier to purchasing a BEV for many consumers—overall, 17% cite access to charging at home or work as a barrier.\\n\\n\\nDwelling circumstances have a meaningful impact on the ability of customers to charge at home, regardless of their preferences:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9% of buyers park on-street and 47% of those don’t have access to charging.\\n\\n\\nA further 9% have dedicated on-street parking, with 39% having no access to charging.\\n\\n\\n22% have private communal parking, with one-third having no access to charging.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, 37% are apartment dwellers—a number on par with detached homeowners. 38% of apartment dwellers have no access to charging versus the 17% of homeowners who don’t.\\n\\n\\nClearly, home charging is both a barrier to Europe’s e-mobility goals and an opportunity for energy providers to capture a new market in providing solutions that respond to customer needs.\\n\\n\\nRethinking Public BEV Charging\\n\\n\\nTurning back to charging outside of the home, 22% of buyers cite “access to public charging/refueling” as a barrier to BEV adoption.\\n\\n\\nExisting BEV owners are interested in the prospect of a charging network that resembles the appearance and density of a petrol filling station, with 79% very or somewhat likely to use one. This idea of creating a “petrol station-like” experience reflects what buyers want as amenities at public charging locations.\\n\\n\\nDelivering Public Charging Amenities Consumers Want\\n\\n\\nEnergy companies have already started to experiment with public charging locations that respond to the needs and desires of the newly e-mobile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the recent \\nEV Charging Infrastructure 2023 Asia-Pacific conference\\n at which I was a speaker, Min Yih Tan from Shell spoke about supporting the ecosystem for current and future BEV owners by providing green electricity and charging at home as well as public charging that is a “full experience” with, for example, coffee and snacks for drivers as they charge their vehicles.\\n\\n\\nShell has shown an example of what this might look like with its recently opened \\nEV charging hub on Fulham Road\\n in London, UK. This station, featuring nine 175 kW DC fast chargers for BEVs, also provides an on-site café with Wi-Fi.\\n\\n\\nTaking a Broad View to BEV Charging Needs\\n\\n\\nSuccessful energy companies will, like Shell, take a broad view of the “fueling” needs of future BEV owners and respond in kind.

However, while home refueling has won over consumers, public charging infrastructure leaves considerable room for improvement—with a leading provider yet to emerge.\\n\\n\\nThat’s according to our 2022 Charging Infrastructure DeepDive report by \\nEVForward\\nTM\\n—the most extensive study of the next generation of EV buyers. The DeepDive explores consumer expectations for home and public charging and identifies opportunities to position solutions for future EV owners.\\n\\n\\nThe EV Range Anxiety Barrier\\n\\n\\nAlthough consumers consistently cite range anxiety as an obstacle to EV purchase, we found that only 8% of EV owners have ever completely run out of charge.\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, 64% say they have never come close, revealing a stark disparity between the expectations and reality of living with an EV. In contrast, more than one in five new car buyers states they have run out of gas at least once in their life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEV ownership may be easier than the majority of drivers expect. Nonetheless, assumptions around range limitations pose a genuine threat to broad adoption, emphasizing the importance of robust public charging infrastructure. Mobile charging services—such as those currently piloted by \\nAAA\\n—can also help reduce the fear of an empty battery on the open road.\\n\\n\\nThe Popularity of Home Charging\\n\\n\\nIncreased public charging infrastructure may help quell consumer doubts. However, providers face limited demand. Home charging is easy, convenient and accessible—something EV drivers fully embrace.\\n\\n\\nEVForward respondents have consistently exhibited a larger appetite for home charging than public charging. According to our most recent data, EV owners expect 73% of their refueling to happen at home. They anticipate charging in public, at work or at school only 25% of the time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis simultaneously demonstrates the need for a comprehensive public charging system along with the narrow market share that providers can expect to claim. If the federal government’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program—which aims to facilitate corridor charging every 50 miles—can meet its goals, then it could go a long way toward addressing the challenges.\\n\\n\\nThe shift toward EVs and home charging will impact existing refueling infrastructure, too. As more consumers embrace EVs, fewer customers will be visiting gas stations. That said, those who do will be there longer as they wait for their car battery to recharge. To adapt to this change, gas stations and convenience stores will need to adjust their model to provide the \\namenities that EV drivers favor\\n, such as cafés with Wi-Fi.\\n\\n\\nShopping Around for EV Charging Solutions\\n\\n\\nWhen purchasing home EV charging technology, dealerships and auto manufacturers are the preferred choice for consumers, with 43% calling them the ideal location to shop for a charger.\\n\\n\\nElectric utilities are a distant second, capturing only 17% of the market, followed closely by options such as physical stores and online retailers. While utilities have the potential to differentiate themselves from the rest of the pack, they are currently underperforming.\\n\\n\\nSimple steps—for example, advertising rebates and incentives on paper bills and online—can help utilities spread awareness, attract customers and establish themselves as a source of truth.\\n\\n\\nWinning EV Charging Customer Loyalty\\n\\n\\nAmong public charging providers, consumers have yet to pick a favorite. Only one in five respondents reports noticing a specific charging brand in their daily life, with Tesla achieving the highest levels of recognition.\\n\\n\\nAs manufacturers—including Mercedes-Benz, General Motors and Ford—announce investments in their own charging infrastructure, it is clear that major players recognize the need for public charging and are willing to build dependable, accessible infrastructure.\\n\\n\\nTo lead the market, brands must focus on compatibility and reliability, ensuring that their public charging solutions are convenient and universal. A resounding 79% of respondents say they would be unlikely to return to a charging network’s stations that lacked compatible plugs with their vehicle. In addition, 40% say that if the charger they pulled up to was not in working order, then they would seriously consider never returning to that brand’s stations again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough standards for public charging are high, consumers remain mostly brand agnostic. When asked whether they would prefer using the same charging brand in public as they use in their home, 61% say they don’t care one way or another—presenting a substantial opportunity for the brand that is willing to build a platform around public charging.\\n\\n\\nBoosting Public EV Charging Infrastructure\\n\\n\\nEV owners and prospective buyers rarely expect to use public charging. Despite this, they want to know that it is available to address the gaps that home charging cannot fill. Many vehicle shoppers hesitate to switch to an EV for fear of running out of charge on longer trips. A stronger public charging infrastructure can help ease consumer concerns.\\n\\n\\nWhile range anxiety may not reflect the lived experience of EV owners, the psychological barrier it represents for would-be owners is real. As charging stations become an increasingly familiar sight, they have the potential to change the narrative for good, removing a powerful hurdle for tomorrow’s EV buyers.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about EVForward and how we can help you tailor your strategy to better reach future EV buyers, click the button below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout the 2022 EVForward™ Charging Infrastructure DeepDive\\n\\n\\nThis EVForward DeepDive was conducted among a national sample of 1,218 respondents—with 53 EV Owner, 423 EV Intender, 488 EV Open, and 254 EV Resistant respondents as identified by Escalent’s algorithm—between August 8 and August 31, 2022.

Our newest fleet electrification study examines attitudes toward brands offering battery electric vehicles (BEVs) through feedback from more than 1,000 fleet decision-makers. It also dives into areas of opportunity to support fleets in their transition to BEVs.\\n\\n\\nThe industry is making slow but steady progress toward the electrified fleet. BEV adoption has increased by 31%, from 13% in 2021 to 17% in 2022. Although more than half of participants remain skeptical of the technology, they are actively preparing for the future: 96% have researched BEVs and 66% are shopping—an increase from 43% last year.\\n\\n\\nFleet Startups Gain Traction\\n\\n\\nAccording to our EVForward\\nTM\\n findings on the next generation of electric vehicle buyers, \\nvehicle brand is an important factor\\n for consumers considering BEV adoption. Can we say the same when it comes to the commercial vehicle and fleet space? Our fleet electrification report measures just that: fleet decision-makers’ brand-related sentiment around four key fleet and commercial vehicle segments: light passenger, commercial van, commercial truck, and medium- and heavy-duty truck.\\n\\n\\nRecognizing the growing diversity of offerings on the market, this year’s study provides enhanced granularity by breaking light-passenger vehicles and commercial trucks and vans into separate categories. Honing in on these more detailed segments offers a closer look at how industry giants are faring compared with startups within each segment. Unsurprisingly, Ford continues to dominate in commercial categories while Tesla holds a monopoly in light-passenger vehicles.\\n\\n\\nEstablished legacy brands persist in outpacing their younger competitors in awareness. That said, attitudes among decision-makers suggest that BEV startups pose a growing threat to established manufacturers. For those familiar with emerging competitors, sentiment toward them often rivals household names—demonstrating the potential of companies like Canoo, Polestar, BrightDrop and BYD to disrupt the market.\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of BEV Grants for Fleets\\n\\n\\nInvesting in fleet electrification is a costly undertaking. This is especially true when considering the outlays associated with charging infrastructure. Government incentives can help offset these expenditures, and support from them among businesses is high. 90% of fleet decision-makers say that the federal government has some degree of responsibility to ease the cost burden associated with adoption. The majority also consider grants and subsidies to be very or somewhat important.\\n\\n\\nSeveral recent initiatives promise to move the needle in this area. Most notably, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a clean vehicle credit of up to $7,500 for passenger vehicles and up to $40,000 for commercial vehicles. In addition, a billion-dollar pool of grants and rebates is available to help states, local governments and transportation associations replace heavy-duty vehicles with those that emit zero emissions.\\n\\n\\nHowever, our findings show a considerable knowledge deficit. Almost 60% of participants said they are unaware of initiatives to subsidize electrifying their fleet. This is particularly problematic for small and medium-sized companies. While smaller businesses could stand to benefit the most from this funding, they often lack the internal resources to seek it out.\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, in cases where decision-makers are aware of government grants, the information does not come from the channels they expect. Businesses say they anticipate hearing about these programs through dealers and manufacturers. In reality, the top source of information is word of mouth. This demonstrates a clear appetite for a more intentional approach to educating commercial customers, further cementing the role of dealerships as strategic advisors to fleet businesses.\\n\\n\\nDealers Can Pave the Way to Electrifying Fleets\\n\\n\\nOur EVForward\\nTM\\n study consistently shows that \\ndealers can have an outsize impact\\n on paving the way for BEV adoption among consumers. In a similar vein for the commercial vehicle space, our Fleet Advisory Hub findings indicate that fleets rely on dealers and manufacturers as trusted sources of information. In particular, fleet decision-makers expect to hear more from dealers about the availability of federal subsidies.\\n\\n\\nEducating customers about government-sponsored programs falls outside retailers’ traditional purview. Nonetheless, for manufacturers looking to gain or maintain a competitive edge, a strong opportunity exists to bridge the knowledge gap by arming dealers and brand-level internal fleet representatives with current and relevant information. Since most decision-makers are learning about federally funded programs via word of mouth, dealer and manufacturer sales representatives also need to dispel misinformation. In doing so, they can solidify their reputation as a go-to resource.\\n\\n\\nOnce again, this is especially relevant for small to mid-sized fleet companies. These businesses are likely to lack the personal relationships with manufacturers or fleet management firms that larger companies lean on for guidance.\\n\\n\\nWhile it is understandable that manufacturers prioritize larger accounts that promise bulk orders, the majority of businesses in the industry are small to medium-sized. By focusing on developing a more robust path to purchase for these prospects—for instance, through a dedicated commercial salesperson who understands the unique demands of a leaner fleet—manufacturers could lay claim to an overlooked but lucrative customer base.\\n\\n\\nHelping Fleets Navigate the Shift to Electric Vehicles\\n\\n\\nRegardless of where they are in their adoption journey, decision-makers understand that the transition to electric vehicles is coming. Dealers and manufacturers are uniquely positioned to help companies navigate this shift.\\n\\n\\nAs startups achieve prominence and established brands expand production, the market will become increasingly crowded. Businesses of all sizes will need help identifying the best solutions for their fleet, which includes decisions about electrified vehicles and charging infrastructure as well as navigating business change management as fleets become electrified.\\n\\n\\nBy stepping into this role more fully, dealers can strengthen relationships with corporate customers, build awareness of the grants that can fuel BEV investment and pave the road toward an all-electric future.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to learn more about these findings and how we can help you prepare to support fleets in their transition to electric vehicles, please click the button below to send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 32, 'Heading': 'Human Security for All in the Age of AI: CES 2023 Takeaways', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/human-security-for-all-in-the-age-of-ai-ces-2023-takeaways/', 'Content': 'There is no doubt that AI, AR, and VR dominated CES 2023. From cooking utensils to gaming enhancements to wellbeing-oriented devices and apps, it was all around. Yet it seemed that companies were still playing it safe by introducing incremental innovations. And while there were some revolutionary concepts like a flying car from Aska, most products and capabilities presented were refinements to concepts that are already on the market. It also seemed that the conference was more about immersion than material products—many innovations went beyond “touch and feel” and needed to be experienced to be fully appreciated.\\n\\n\\nAdvanced technologies, like AI, give unprecedented tools for content creation, provide access to well-being management at one’s fingertips, as well as opportunities to enhance human experiences in the metaverse. At the same time, they come with a high burden of trust for users. From allowing personal information to be collected and trusting computers while driving, to allowing technology to write the first sentences of your creative piece, we are a long way from being comfortable with digital presence in our everyday lives.\\n\\n\\nThis year, for the first time, CES had a central theme, “Human Security for All.” But instead of focusing on potential security risks, the theme was about collaboration between players and technology as an avenue for tools that would solve threats to humanity such as food shortage, supply-chain issues, and health hazards.\\n\\n\\nAnd, what about the metaverse? While it was on full display, the prevailing attitude was that it is not a replacement for real life. Rather, it works as an environment where one can have an experience that is otherwise not possible in the physical world. For example, Sony and Manchester City showcased a proof of concept that enables one to experience an event from a variety of viewpoints. I experienced the concept first-hand, viewing a prior game from the soccer players’ perspective—something I would not have been able to do even if I had attended the game in person. The Sony-Manchester City partnership was first announced in November 2021 and promises an exciting experience for all soccer fans. Just imagine being able to watch and rewatch World Cup games this way!\\n\\n\\nGiven my background and focus at Escalent, I am keyed into all things \\ntechnology\\n. Here are a handful of the other trends I found most interesting:\\n\\n\\nTrend 1: Enabling Creators and Fueling Creator Economy\\n\\n\\nTechnology brings many tools to the content creation industry, from de-aging, to dubbing, to script writing powered by ChatGPT. There is also a possibility of synthetic actors. Yet, the question remains: Will these tools ever replace human talents? The dominant opinion right now is that these are enhancements, not replacements. There is still a human element of creativity and personalization that AI cannot replicate.\\n\\n\\nIn addition, there are many issues to be solved. For example, AI needs a pool of knowledge to produce outputs, and that pool of knowledge comes from existing work that is likely licensed. How does the industry ensure proper compensation when AI utilizes elements of human work (be it music or story elements) that someone else had rights to before? This question remains to be answered.\\n\\n\\nTrend 2: Interactivity for All and Advertainment\\n\\n\\nOutside of being hypnotized by Sam Asghari, I was completely blown away by how technology can now allow viewers to influence the final outcome of the content they are watching.\\n\\n\\nAdvertainment was another CES buzzword. With technology advancements, there are new opportunities for advertising and entertainment industries to join forces and create commercials that engage without interrupting. In an environment where consumers do not want to pay for streaming but are not receptive to traditional advertisements that interrupt their content, advertainment might just become the new secret sauce. It might also come in the form of company-sponsored content (like \\nMr. Right\\n) or product placement. Think of the number of times you’ve watched a movie or a series and wondered where you could buy that outfit or a hot tech gadget. How cool would it be to click and buy it in the moment? It just might be a win-win for all.\\n\\n\\nTrend 3: Focus on Mental Health and Wellbeing\\n\\n\\nIt may be a lingering effect of the pandemic but focus on mental health and wellbeing was big at CES this year. My favorite was a meditation app from Tripp that merges beautiful visuals, calming sounds, and gaming elements (think Candy Crush Saga) to calm your mind in a VR experience. It’s funded from the Amazon Alexa app and is available on a variety of devices, including Meta Quest headset and PlayStation VR.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to VR meditation, I saw headsets that diagnose your mental wellbeing, a smart toilet that collects your urine sample to provide an on-the-spot diagnosis, AI-based sleep tracking technology from ASLEEP, and so much more. Focus on health and wellbeing is here to stay, and tech is all over it!\\n\\n\\nTrend 4: Screens, Screens, and Beyond\\n\\n\\nAs we get more mobile, screens are dominating in cars. My Escalent colleagues in our \\nAutomotive & Mobility\\n practice noted a focus on immersive, entertaining in-car experiences. Of course, entertainment needs content, and providing content on the go needs connectivity. And while the debate on whether the car will soon become a computer on wheels is still ongoing, technology continues to play an important role in the automotive space. How about a karaoke screen in the car? I bet James Corden would get on board with that!\\n\\n\\nBeyond cars, screens also dominated the wellness space. Would you like to get fit in front of the screen? Watch out stand-desk concept—the new kid on the block is a desk-bike combination that charges your device. Unveiled by Acer, the eKinekt BD3 bike desk uses kinetic energy generated from pedaling to charge your devices. Count me in for this new style of working from home.\\n\\n\\nTrend 5: Extension\\n\\n\\nWhile we’re talking about screens, opportunities for extending them into real life while gaming were all around us. A company called unveiled their AI gaming sync box kit that synchronizes smart lights to bring in-game moments into your surroundings.\\n\\n\\nWant to extend/clone yourself into the digital world? Ploonet, a subsidiary of the Korean-based AI firm Saltlux, enables you to create a clone for the digital world, so this “metahuman” can attend your business meeting in your place.\\n\\n\\nAnd, of course, everyone knows Roblox and Walmart recently jumped on this popularity train by launching Walmart Land and Walmart’s Universe of Play. Now you can go to Walmart “isles” in the digital world to collect merchandise and unlock exclusive interactive content. Walmart Land promises to extend the best fashion, style, beauty, and entertainment from the physical into the digital world.\\n\\n\\nTrend 6: “Hey, Alexa … Siri … Disney?”\\n\\n\\nAmazon is partnering with Panasonic Automotive to provide an update to Panasonic’s in-vehicle entertainment system that gives drivers access to Alexa or Siri features in Apple CarPlay.\\xa0 Customers are no longer limited to one device and that’s ok. Communicate however you are most comfortable!\\n\\n\\nAnd speaking of being comfortable, let’s face the fact that our kids will enjoy talking to famous Disney characters way more than Siri or Alexa. A new partnership between Amazon and Disney lets you chat with famous Disney characters through Echo at-home devices or while at Disney resort hotels. Whose kid doesn’t want to talk to Mickey Mouse or play trivia games with Olaf?\\n\\n\\nTrend 7: Self-reliance\\n\\n\\nFrom at-home diagnostics and testing for viruses and growing your own food to managing your mental health, many companies are helping consumers become self-sufficient through technology.\\n\\n\\nLG presented its indoor gardening appliance, providing access to all the goodness of greens year-round. The unit, called Tiiun (which means “to sprout” in Korean), features two shelves to grow your own greens in an urban environment.\\n\\n\\nAnd how many of us are tired of throwing away fruits and vegetables that go bad? Green Life Tech’s product, FreshDefend\\nTM\\n, is a smart countertop system that promises to preserve the shelf life of your fruits and vegetables five-fold. Imagine how much that would cut down on waste, not to mention the money you’d save.\\n\\n\\nSo many questions remain!\\n\\n\\nAlthough there were lots of cool innovations to explore, many larger companies were not willing to take huge leaps on technologies – they would rather showcase something closer to reality/ home/what already exists. This is not surprising, given losses in investments on metaverse, cryptocurrency and NFTs.\\n\\n\\nGiven political and economic uncertainties that caused a less-than-desired end to 2022, the tech industry is likely to lean to the “safer” side in 2023. Doing more with less and in the most efficient way will likely be the trend moving forward, for both consumers and businesses.\\n\\n\\nWhile revolutionary concepts, like metaverse, will not go away completely, the focus is likely to shift towards products and concepts that empower consumers, save them money, give them control, simplify their everyday tasks, and contribute to sustainable ways of life. As businesses are faced with limited budgets, efficient spending will become more important than ever. This means strategic investments will be top of mind with less focus on “build it and they will come.”\\n\\n\\nWant to know who your customers are and what \\nproduct innovations\\n they want you to build?'}\n","{'Index': 33, 'Heading': 'Market Research & The Perils and Promise of Disruption in 2023', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/market-research-the-perils-and-promise-of-disruption-in-2023/', 'Content': 'For some, the word “disruption” immediately conjures up visions of upheaval, displacement, chaos, and even loss (of time, money, and security), all of which can certainly be true. Disruption means change from what we know and expect, and that is often uncomfortable and sometimes even painful.\\n\\n\\nHowever, disruption can also be an incredibly positive force that creates conditions for new markets, innovations, and opportunities for vibrant growth. When addressed appropriately, disruption can force us to look at our world in new ways, accept change, and look for ways to adapt, evolve, and grow.\\n\\n\\nWhile disruption can therefore be an intimidating prospect, the firms that best understand and harness the forces of change are the ones that will not only survive, but also thrive, by exploiting new and exciting growth opportunities.\\n\\n\\nDisruption paves the way for innovation\\n\\n\\nAll of that said, navigating market disruption is never easy, as illustrated by some major market disruptions in the past.

Of course, the advent of the automobile soon changed that statistic.\\n\\n\\nCarriage manufacturers soon learned that a transition to automobile manufacturing would require more than mechanizing a carriage. Not only were motors a completely new technology for carriage makers to learn, but automobiles also required metalworking skills rather than the fine woodworking typical of carriage design. As a result, the vast majority carriage makers failed to make a successful transition to mechanized transportation.\\n\\n\\nThe one carriage maker who evolved and succeeded in the automotive arena was Studebaker. They did so by recognizing where the market was going and determining what skills would be needed. Specifically, they acquired other firms that had the necessary metalworking skills to make Studebaker a successful automobile manufacturer.\\n\\n\\nMore than 100 years later, the automotive industry is once again facing great disruption. Given the increasingly devastating effects of climate change, the industry is moving away from vehicles powered by an internal combustion engine and moving to product lines dominated by \\nelectric vehicles\\n. This represents a significant disruption as legacy automakers need to make this transition without negatively impacting their current product lines and revenue streams. At the same time, Tesla has thrived as a new market entrant by understanding the opportunity for market disruption, the desires of consumers, and the strategy necessary to establish itself as the EV market leader.\\n\\n\\nOf course, technological innovation isn’t the only source of disruption in today’s world. As we learned over the past few years, disruption can result from a wide range of social, economic, and geopolitical forces:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA global pandemic caused havoc with the world’s supply chain and required firms to consider how they might reshape their future sourcing strategies.\\n\\n\\nShortages combined with surging demand created serious inflation, and manufacturers have scrambled to restock their inventories while paying more to do so. Consumers have also felt the pain as they face higher prices for gas, automobiles, groceries, and more.\\n\\n\\nIn an effort to tame inflation, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times in 2022 alone. While a necessary counter to inflation, higher interest rates risk producing a recessionary environment in 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket research’s role in 2023’s uncertainty\\n\\n\\nSo, what do all of these disruptions, both actual and potential, mean for businesses in the year ahead? Uncertainty. Specifically, firms are now grappling with how to best plan, staff, and navigate the uncertainty that accompanies disruption.\\n\\n\\nIn short, after years of operating within a more predictable and healthier economic climate, organizations now face new challenges that will test their business acumen and decision-making skills. How well businesses succeed in understanding and addressing their changing landscape could very well be the difference between falling behind/failing or adapting, innovating, and exploiting new opportunities for greater success.\\n\\n\\nIn this new environment, businesses need to focus on much more than building demand for their products. Instead, they will need to consider a multitude of factors including:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat market forces are at work and how they could positively or negatively impact sales\\n\\n\\nHow to best respond to continued material shortages to produce the optimal mix of products that maximizes sales and minimizes customer dissatisfaction and attrition\\n\\n\\nHow inflation is impacting material and labor costs and the pricing strategy that would be advisable given a need to both protect profitability and customer loyalty\\n\\n\\nWhat product or service innovations fill significant customer needs and are compelling enough to succeed even in a challenging economic environment\\n\\n\\nWhat business partnerships and/or acquisitions are necessary in order to stay relevant in the market\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, more than ever, organizations need help understanding current and future disruptions that will impact \\nmarket dynamics\\n, \\ncustomer needs and mindset\\n, and their firm’s \\nproduct portfolio\\n. In turn, firms need to thoughtfully invest in mining market insights to navigate a choppy economy, avoid potential threats, and pursue new growth opportunities.\\n\\n\\nWe at Escalent see ourselves as catalysts of progress for industries and firms facing disruption. We deliver on that vision by offering a comprehensive set of advisory, primary and \\nsecondary research\\n, \\ndata analytics\\n, \\nbehavioral science\\n, \\ndesign thinking\\n, and \\na \\nteam of \\nimp\\nl\\nementation consult\\nants\\n\\u202f\\n\\xa0to address just about any marketing challenge.

Despite being released in Mexico, the ads were in English and quickly went global as \\ncritics decried the campaign for greenwashing\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo be clear, at Escalent, we believe greenwashing—as well as all deceptive forms of advertising—is wrong. Dishonesty destroys trust, which is hard to earn in the first place and even harder to regain once broken, be it among people or with brands. However, this is not a blog about greenwashing; rather, it’s about a more fundamental error that Leo Burnett committed by anchoring its advertising message on the environmental benefits of EVs in the first place.\\n\\n\\nAfter three years and more than 50,000 consumer interviews in the US and Europe, our \\nEVForward\\nTM\\n study of future EV buyers\\n concludes that environmental messaging \\ndoes not\\n move the needle on EV sales or brand perceptions. As part of this research program, we identified twelve distinct future EV buyer personas between the US and Europe, and there is not one consumer segment for which environmental messaging increases EV purchase consideration. Put more simply: consumers are either concerned about the environment and convinced that EVs help address those concerns, or environmentalism is simply not part of consumers’ decision-making process in purchasing a vehicle.\\n\\n\\nAs a concrete example, let’s examine the six segments of future EV buyers we identified in the US.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Young Enthusiast segment over-indexes on likelihood to buy a luxury midsized or large car or SUV for their next vehicle. In other words, this segment is the target market for Mercedes-Benz and its EQ vehicles. However, environmental sustainability isn’t important to Young Enthusiasts in their choice of vehicles, and they are significantly less likely to expect an EV to provide environmental benefits. These consumers just don’t care about the environmental benefits of EVs, so a campaign like Leo Burnett’s Nature or Nothing will fall on deaf ears.\\n\\n\\nWhat does resonate with future Young Enthusiast EV buyers?\\n\\n\\nThey are much more in tune with exterior styling and in-vehicle technology than the average new-car buyer. They also expect EVs to deliver technological leadership and a unique style that helps Young Enthusiasts stand out among their peers. These buyers are looking for a vehicle that makes a positive statement about themselves to others and provides a “cool” factor—so brands and marketers who want to inspire these consumers to purchase EVs need to focus on those benefits.\\n\\n\\nWith that said, it is not just a matter of \\nsaying\\n the right things to consumers. Successful brands deliver products and services that fill gaps, solve problems or simply delight, ensuring all messaging aligns with what the brands truly have to offer. It is only by doing this that brands can build and sustain consumer trust, which leads to brand loyalty. It takes a lot of hard work to truly understand and effectively communicate with consumers about the things that are most important to them—but this leads to a more honest, authentic consumer-brand relationship.\\n\\n\\nEscalent has developed comprehensive profiles of each of the EVForward new-car buyer personas—including media consumption, hobbies and social media use—which can be used to develop effective ad campaigns that tap into the real needs and expectations of future EV buyers to move them to action. And we’ve gone beyond that to allow marketers and advertisers to effectively reach the buyer personas most likely to purchase an EV as their next vehicle (which include Young Enthusiasts) through brand audiences, with distribution to more than 400 partners including Adobe, Pandora, Outbrain and major social media platforms.\\n\\n\\nIf you’re interested in learning more about EVForward, our buyer personas or our brand audiences, please reach out to me by clicking the button below.'}\n","{'Index': 35, 'Heading': 'More BEV Exposure Leads to Higher BEV Purchase Intent', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/more-bev-exposure-leads-to-higher-bev-purchase-intent/', 'Content': 'Each year, we recruit 10,000+ new-car buyers to participate in our \\nEVForward\\nTM\\n research program\\n on the next generation of electric vehicle (EV) buyers, which includes battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Using more than 600 data points, including factors such as past behavior, life values, and the vehicle habits of their circle of influence, we categorize respondents into four groups based on their likelihood to shop for an EV: EV Owners, EV Intenders, EV Open and EV Resistant.\\n\\n\\nEV Intenders are 15 times more likely to shop for a BEV than the average new-car buyer, making them low-hanging fruit for dealers and automakers. However, within that group, there are broad differences in motivation and intention, according to our new Heavy EV Intender DeepDive report. In this report, we broke the EV Intender group into “Heavy” and “Light” EV Intender subgroups based on the distribution of our EVForward\\nTM\\n score, a proprietary scoring algorithm that predicts each respondent’s likelihood to shop for a BEV in the next five years.\\n\\n\\nHow BEV Exposure Impacts Heavy and Light EV Intenders\\n\\n\\nExamining BEV exposure uncovers differences between the two groups and highlights the importance of consumer exposure to BEVs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlmost 70% of Heavy EV Intenders have family and friends with a BEV. Approximately 29% have driven or ridden in one, and they give the experience high marks, with more than 90% saying it felt better than driving a gas or diesel vehicle.\\n\\n\\nAs a result of their exposure, Heavy EV Intenders also have a better understanding of the costs of owning a BEV—and are prepared to pay them. They recognize the need to invest in Level 2 home charging, and 89% say they are willing to pay to install it. When asked to estimate the costs, they have a far more realistic picture of the price tag.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, only 14% of Light EV Intenders report having some experience in a BEV. They also underestimate the installation cost by several hundred dollars, and only 65% say they are willing to make the investment.\\n\\n\\nAutomakers and dealers can address these gaps by:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncreasing communication and providing more informational resources around the realities, costs and advantages of owning a BEV.\\n\\n\\nOffering opportunities to get consumers into the driving seat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth EV Intender groups agree that hands-on experiences, such as test drives, matter. Almost 100% of Heavy EV Intenders and 79% of Light EV Intenders said that riding or driving experience influenced their decision to purchase their current vehicle, and Heavy EV Intenders have a much higher likelihood to say that they have driven or know BEV powertrains well.\\n\\n\\nBecause Light EV Intenders lack an in-depth understanding of the BEV ecosystem, they may be particularly influenced by traditional dealership experiences that provide personalized BEV education and by the brand recognition that BEVs from established automakers can offer.\\n\\n\\nBEV Exposure Generates Excitement\\n\\n\\nThe exposure to BEVs, both from friends and family and through driving the powertrain, translates to excitement and a high likelihood Heavy EV Intenders will purchase a BEV for their next vehicle.\\n\\n\\nHeavy EV Intenders hold BEVs in high esteem, see them as overwhelmingly practical, and are 20 times more likely to shop for a BEV than the average consumer. While Heavy EV Intenders still have concerns about range and charging availability, citing these as primary barriers to purchase, they have already familiarized themselves with the powertrain and the various ways to accommodate their charging needs. When asked how likely they are to purchase a vehicle with a battery electric powertrain, Heavy EV Intenders score BEVs at 91 out of 100.\\n\\n\\nLight EV Intenders, on the other hand, score lower across all BEV metrics. They demonstrate less understanding of BEVs and have more concerns about the practicalities of owning one. Additionally, they are less likely to have previous exposure to BEVs and, therefore, less likely to be convinced of the benefits. Giving BEVs a 56 out of 100 when asked how likely they are to purchase one, Light EV Intenders demonstrate significant interest in other drivetrains, including internal combustion engines. This suggests Light EV Intenders are likely to consider both gas vehicles and BEVs during the shopping process.\\n\\n\\nFactors That Motivate BEV Consideration and Purchase\\n\\n\\nLight and Heavy EV Intenders look for different things in a vehicle, too. Threats to the environment loom large in Heavy EV Intenders’ minds: 89% said they considered climate change a significant problem and see owning a BEV as a way to make a difference.\\n\\n\\nHeavy EV Intenders are also 2.5 times more likely to be “innovators”—consumers who like to be among the first to try new products, based on the diffusion of innovation theory. Buyer motivations reflect this, with 87% of Heavy EV Intenders saying they love the new technology that is becoming available.\\n\\n\\nWhile Heavy EV Intenders are acutely climate-aware and often already sure that a BEV is the right choice for them, Light EV Intenders are not as motivated by environmental concerns even though 78% say they are a major problem. Relative to Heavy EV Intenders, Light EV Intenders are more concerned with battery life and replacement costs, charging inconvenience and reliability.\\n\\n\\nAs a result, the messaging needs of both groups vary. Heavy EV Intenders are the low-hanging fruit likely to be driven by emotional conversations highlighting the environmental benefits of driving a BEV and \\nappealing to consumers’ self-actualization desires\\n to be seen by peers as future-looking and pioneering with cutting-edge technology. Light EV Intenders, meanwhile, will be a bit harder to reach, requiring reassurances around practical issues such as quietness, reliability and battery life.\\n\\n\\nSmoothing the Path to Purchase for EV Intenders\\n\\n\\nRather than relying on Light EV Intenders to do their own research, automakers and dealers can play a crucial role in boosting enthusiasm and addressing barriers to purchase by investing in efforts to educate prospective buyers about the value, reliability and efficiency of BEVs. Ride-and-drive events, test drives and BEV service loaners all offer additional opportunities to close the exposure gap between Light and Heavy EV Intenders.\\n\\n\\nWhile Heavy EV Intenders are typically comfortable forging the way with new technology, the next wave of BEV buyers will demonstrate more caution. For the more BEV-wary consumers, facilitating driving experiences and \\nenhancing messaging around the personal benefits and emotional aspirations of BEV ownership\\n may be the tipping point on the path to purchase.\\n\\n\\nIn our report, we cover a much wider breadth of findings on Heavy and Light EV Intenders, including insights into shopping behaviors, lifestyles, EV brand recognition, retail approaches, charging attitudes, and what EV players can do to better reach and impact this audience.

Car buyers are more familiar with available models, with 49% saying they have driven a BEV or feel they know BEVs well—a boost from 43% in 2021.\\n\\n\\nAs more drivers take the plunge, exposure is increasing, too. In 2021, 32% of car owners said they knew a friend or relative with a BEV. This year, that figure has risen to 45%.\\n\\n\\nHowever, as adoption increases, automakers need to move beyond messaging that focuses on the environmental and financial perks and tap into the emotional aspects of BEV ownership. That’s according to the latest data from Escalent’s 2022 \\nEVForward\\nTM\\n Europe report.\\n\\n\\nThis study surveyed respondents across five European countries—the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain—who intend to purchase a new vehicle within the next five years. While the report uncovered promising gains in buyer sentiment, it also revealed a significant gap between vehicle shoppers’ core motivations and the current positioning of BEVs.\\n\\n\\nAs the pool of first-time BEV owners grows, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) need to do more to connect with the emotional motives of prospective buyers.\\n\\n\\nThe Limits of Green for BEV Shoppers\\n\\n\\nTraditionally, messaging around BEVs has focused heavily on the benefits to the planet and consumers’ wallets.\\n\\n\\nHowever, according to our new research, relatively few buyers are moved by such a narrow range of rational criteria, even as the volatility of gas prices places extra pressure on European drivers. In fact, BEV owners have more in common with non-owners on environmental factors than on other car ownership attitudes: 81% of BEV owners and 79% of non-owners agree that climate change is a significant problem.\\n\\n\\nBoth groups desire to address the issue through their vehicle choice. 78% of BEV owners said they wanted to drive an environmentally friendly car, a view shared by 71% of non-owners. Despite this, while 43% of respondents acknowledge the green credentials of BEVs, they rank this quality ninth out of 19 in the hierarchy of car-buying criteria, indicating that concern for the environment does not translate directly to a purchase.\\n\\n\\nInstead, BEV owners show strong enthusiasm for their vehicle and welcome the promise of new technology, fun and discovery—or EV-joyment.\\n\\n\\nSeeking EV-Joyment\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s findings demonstrate a departure from the long-standing belief that BEV adoption is driven primarily by a commitment to the planet. The findings also reveal a deficit in the current approach to attracting new buyers.\\n\\n\\nA fundamental change is happening in the psychological makeup of consumers considering BEVs. The personas in our study demonstrate significant evolution—a shift that points to automakers needing to adopt broad, exciting and inclusive positioning. Rather than honing in on social responsibility, OEMs should tap into buyers’ positive emotions and aspirations.\\n\\n\\nBEV penetration is already much deeper in European markets than in the US. The vehicles are becoming a status symbol among consumers who consider themselves pioneers, particularly as they see their peer group embrace EVs.\\n\\n\\nNew technology can spur people’s imaginations in a way philanthropic messaging may not. Automakers and dealers must move beyond climate-conscious positioning and focus on messaging that ignites buyers’ passions, injecting more joy into the transaction.\\n\\n\\nRethinking EV Charging Infrastructure\\n\\n\\nAs buyer attitudes evolve, confidence in EV charging infrastructure is also growing, slowly eroding what once represented a significant barrier to purchase.\\n\\n\\nToday’s buyers recognize a steady increase in public charging infrastructure. Of those surveyed, 48% indicated they now believe 21%–60% of car parks and shopping malls have installed charging points, up eight percentage points from 2021.\\n\\n\\nJust as experiencing BEVs through peers can quell the fear of the unknown, understanding the infrastructure available—and seeing its growth—can move buyers toward consideration and help establish BEVs as a practical choice.\\n\\n\\nBut if European countries are to meet their ambitious electrification goals, regional, national and commercial organizations still have significant work to do to expand the availability and awareness of public charging.\\n\\n\\nOne way to do this is for providers to design destinations that have charging stations alongside other alluring amenities that appeal to consumers’ self-image and lifestyle desires. For example, survey respondents selected Wi-Fi and a café as their top two choices of services they want available while charging a BEV.\\n\\n\\nA New Direction for BEVs\\n\\n\\nBEVs are seeing steady gains in sentiment, which is good news for OEMs. In 2022, 41% of car owners view BEVs more positively, up from 36% in 2021. Additionally, 18% of consumers said their next car will be a BEV: a six-percentage-point boost.\\n\\n\\nHowever, as EV registrations grow in Europe, customers within the BEV segment increasingly espouse diverse values, lifestyles and attitudes. Often, these broad differences do not neatly align with either the traditional mindset of an established brand buyer or a stereotypical EV owner.\\n\\n\\nWinning over the next wave of BEV adopters will take more than the “same old.” Brands would do well to listen before they sell—and learn to embrace a new set of buyer motivations rooted in the emotional aspirations of vehicle ownership.\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to learn more about our findings, EVForward or how we can help you refine your BEV strategy, click the button below to connect with us.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout EVForward™ Europe 2022\\n\\n\\nThe second annual wave of the EVForward Europe study was conducted across five European countries: United Kingdom (n=1,941), Germany (n=2,011), France (n=1,723), Italy (n=1,915) and Spain (n=1,806).

It powers the ways we work, travel and shop, and it holds the potential to solve some of the world’s most pressing issues—from improving health outcomes to advancing clean energy.\\n\\n\\nThe adoption of new technology hinges on several things: an innovative concept, a credible brand, and a clear benefit. But nothing is more vital than trust—without it, technology’s potential for good is undermined.\\n\\n\\nDesigning questions that get to the heart of consumer trust can be challenging and consumers may struggle to identify and articulate their confidence level in a particular technology. That’s why Escalent created Tech TrustBuilder™, a scientifically validated tool that measures trust and its key components.\\n\\n\\nBuilding on years of \\nAutomotive & Mobility research\\n into consumer trust in autonomous vehicles (AVs), Tech TrustBuilder employs \\nbehavioral science\\n principles and advanced data analyses to transform the complex topic of trust in a particular technology into something that is approachable, measurable and addressable. In doing so, Tech TrustBuilder empowers brands to build and foster consumer confidence in the products, services and experiences they offer.\\n\\n\\nThe Three Components of Technology Trust\\n\\n\\nTrust is foundational in that it informs every consumer decision. But it is also complex, fragile and difficult to measure. What is trust, how can it be measured and how can we earn it?\\n\\n\\nTo answer this question, Escalent undertook an extensive academic literature review of research on trust—in particular, trust in technology. Three core components emerged from this undertaking: competency, process and intent. Competency measures consumer perceptions of the technology’s ability. Process deals with how the technology accomplishes its goal. Intent addresses the technology’s ultimate purpose. Together, they are the three building blocks of trust in technology.\\n\\n\\nFrom this understanding, Escalent developed Tech TrustBuilder, a tool that provides a granular understanding of how these components come together to indicate trust, or lack thereof, in a particular technology.\\n\\n\\nThe Benefit of Listening Vs. Talking When It Comes to Trust\\n\\n\\nThe three components uniquely contribute to revealing trust in technology.\\n\\n\\nToo often, brands assume they simply need to educate consumers about the advantages of their offerings to prompt adoption. In the case of autonomous vehicles, automakers have primarily focused their efforts on explaining the benefits of autonomous transportation in hopes of increasing market penetration.\\n\\n\\nHowever, our findings demonstrate that trust-building happens on multiple, deeper levels. Tech TrustBuilder scored consumer trust in AV technology at 50 on a 100-point scale. When viewed within the context of previous years of Escalent’s research, this indicates consumer trust in AV technology has plateaued and not changed despite industry efforts.\\n\\n\\nAutomakers may have captured the confidence of early adopters but have made little progress in tapping into the broader market. To further build trust—particularly among consumers who are slow to embrace new technology—automakers will need to address people’s real concerns and perceptions.\\n\\n\\nWhile understanding the motivation behind the technology (intent) and the way in which technology goes about achieving its goal (process) is important, we uncovered that the greatest driver of trust is the predictability and ability of technology (competency).\\n\\n\\nIronically, consumers in our survey scored the competency of AV technology the lowest of the three components, which indicates that a lot more trust-building at the most important level is necessary. Automakers can \\ntell\\n consumers about the benefits of AVs, but until consumers \\nfeel\\n AV technology will reliably do what it is supposed to do in all conditions, consumers are unlikely to get on board.\\n\\n\\nKnowing Your Audience to Build Trust Effectively\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s findings also demonstrate clear differences between high-trust and low-trust consumers—especially regarding their emotions.\\n\\n\\nRespondents with high trust in AV technology were more likely to feel safe, brave and intrigued, naturally aligning with early adopters. On the other hand, the low-trust group demonstrated visceral, negative emotions, including nervousness, worry and suspicion.\\n\\n\\nWhile early adopters play a crucial role in socializing new technology, brands need to appeal to the masses to achieve broad success. AVs offer the promise of mobility for everyone regardless of factors such as age, access and ability. To achieve that lofty goal, automakers need to bridge the trust gap with consumers who are apprehensive about the implications of autonomous transportation. Automakers will need a deep awareness of where consumer concerns lie—and a clear understanding of how to change the picture.\\n\\n\\nWith insights from the Tech TrustBuilder solution, brands can do just that. By assessing each component of trust—competency, process and intent—Escalent can identify which is underperforming, pinpoint problematic perceptions within a brand’s consumer base and recommend tangible actions to promote adoption.\\n\\n\\nMoving the Trust Needle for the Greater Good\\n\\n\\nTechnology is designed to make the world better. To unlock its life-changing potential, brands need to build and retain consumer trust.\\n\\n\\nWhere other surveys demonstrate the broad landscape in which a product or offering operates, Tech TrustBuilder empowers brands to identify specific barriers to trust. By breaking down the concept of trust into three distinct components, we can establish benchmarks to measure where technology stands with consumers.\\n\\n\\nIn doing so, we can use what we know about human behavior to help people see, feel and believe in the benefits of technology—clearing the road for adoption.\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to learn more about the study or Tech TrustBuilder, please click the button below to send us a note.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout Tech TrustBuilder™\\n\\n\\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of approximately 4,300 consumers age 18 and older from August 2021 to January 2022.

It’s hard to forget the firehose of unprecedented events that kicked off the decade.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhat will be 2022’s Word of the Year? In some ways, the Economist Intelligence Unit at Harvard University has already found it—with research. Economists tracked the frequency of the word “uncertainty” in relation to descriptions of economic conditions and, you guessed it. The use of the word “uncertainty” is rising. As is our anxiety.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe question now is what to do about it. A recent article in \\nHarvard Business Review \\n(\\nHBR\\n) took this unsettling research finding and delved in further. The authors recommend three strategies businesses should use in response to rising uncertainty, starting now.\\u202f\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPay More Attention to Geopolitics and “Uncertainty Shocks”\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe HBR authors distinguish “economic shocks” from what they call “uncertainty shocks.” While business leaders are accustomed to following economic shocks—and indeed, these two types of shocks often coincide—the authors advocate for keeping a keener eye on uncertainty shocks.\\u202f\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhat’s an uncertainty shock? It’s an event that sends out shockwaves, triggering a sort of global anxiety attack. The article points to five major uncertainty shocks in the last six years: Brexit, the 2016 US election, China-US trade tensions, COVID, and now, the war in Ukraine. These types of global shocks aren’t going away. If anything, they’re accelerating.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHBR recommendation:\\u202f\\n“Invest in the people and tools to track geopolitics more closely, with special focus on the issues and regions that most affect your business.”\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFind Flexible Support\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn turbulent times, it’s tempting to retreat. To keep doing the same thing because, with all this uncertainty, now is not the time to try something new. But the authors advise that in times of uncertainty, businesses need more flexibility, to pivot quickly, change course and chase the data rippling out of global shockwaves. Solutions such as flexible staffing can ensure you’ll be able to adapt to what the future brings.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHBR recommendation:\\u202f\\n“Greater uncertainty makes flexibility more valuable.

But to remain competitive with alternative sales and service models, gaps in the consumer experience need to be addressed.\\n\\n\\nAn Important Touch Point for Selling EVs\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to purchasing and maintaining an EV, consumers consider the dealership a key touch point.\\n\\n\\nWhile almost one-quarter of respondents said they would consider purchasing an EV directly from the manufacturer, nearly all new-vehicle buyers rely on dealers during their shopping process: 94% of respondents reported contacting a dealership the last time they shopped for a vehicle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn particular, consumers indicated that dealers are top of mind for questions regarding warranties, rebates and incentives. With the changes to the federal EV tax credit contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, it is all the more important for dealers to provide guidance around rebates and incentives.\\n\\n\\nHowever, only 48% of EV owners said they received a rebate or incentive when they purchased their vehicle. Many expressed that they did not feel their dealer supported them in identifying available rebates and incentives. On a five-point scale, 65% rated the helpfulness of their dealer at a three or below. This gap between customer expectations and experience is critical for OEMs and dealerships to address.\\n\\n\\nWhile 88% of buyers said they were satisfied with their dealership experience, consumers gave lower marks to staff knowledge of EV charging. Although EV owners generally have a greater degree of comfort with new technology, future buyers aren’t quite as comfortable. As a trusted source of information, dealers can improve the customer experience—and potentially boost sales significantly—by providing more robust support around the “fueling” experience for customers.\\n\\n\\nConsumers demonstrated an appetite for in-person experiences during both vehicle shopping and ownership. 69% of respondents said they rely on dealers to provide repairs and service. Meanwhile, 66% thought test drives should happen through the dealer, and more than half said purchasing or leasing the vehicle—including pricing, negotiation and discounts—should take place at the dealership.\\n\\n\\nCentering Consumer Preference\\n\\n\\nEV specialist automakers have instigated a shift toward leaner, online-oriented retail approaches, including remote services and branded stores with minimal inventory. Traditional OEMs are starting to follow the trend—but consumers have mixed feelings.\\n\\n\\nFewer than half of all survey respondents would be comfortable if their vehicle shopping, purchasing or leasing, and maintenance phases were shifted entirely online or to the customer’s home. On the other hand, the post-COVID-19 consumer is more comfortable—and in some cases, expects—the convenience of virtual engagement and mobile services. EV specialist approaches that enhance consumer control and convenience, such as mobile service and scheduling appointments online, scored higher marks.\\n\\n\\nThe takeaway? OEMs and dealers should make decisions based on consumer preference rather than just mirroring the tactics employed by EV specialists. An omnichannel approach, where buyers can seamlessly and effortlessly complete any phase of their transaction via their preferred channel, can help to balance convenience with the peace of mind that an in-person visit can offer.\\n\\n\\nInventory Limitations: Acceptable, But Not Ideal\\n\\n\\nAs inventory limitations due to supply chain constraints continue to plague dealers, buyers are extending understanding—up to a point. Consumers are willing to order their vehicle and wait, but most consider seven weeks to be too long. 70% of survey respondents said they would be willing to wait less than a month before they pivot to purchase or lease a different vehicle. 46% would be willing to wait a few weeks, and 24% would wait only a few days.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile consumers would prefer dealerships to have enough inventory to see and experience their vehicle in person, most do not blame the dealer or the manufacturer for the current shortages. 91% of respondents said a long wait time would have somewhat, or no, negative impact on their perception of the dealership, while 94% said the same for the vehicle brand.\\n\\n\\nBuilding Trust; Instilling Confidence in EV Shoppers\\n\\n\\nFor consumers, the dealer is still the preferred source of information when buying a new vehicle. But buyer pain points, such as dissatisfaction with the level of staff expertise on EV-specific issues, represent vulnerabilities in the current model.\\n\\n\\nTo increase buyer confidence, dealerships must continue to deliver superior in-person service—and be ready to educate consumers on the ins and outs of EV ownership. Dealers should be prepared to go beyond the capabilities and features of the vehicle and speak to all aspects of the EV ecosystem, including incentives, rebates and charging.\\n\\n\\nBy shaping their model around consumer preferences and behavior, and enhancing their capacity to paint a complete picture of owning an EV, dealers can continue to be a trusted touch point for the next generation of electric vehicle buyers.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about EVForward and how we can help you tailor your strategy to better reach future EV buyers, send us a note by clicking the button below.'}\n","{'Index': 41, 'Heading': 'How to Tap Into Hard-to-Reach Audiences When Mapping Your Customer Journey', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/how-to-tap-into-hard-to-reach-audiences-when-mapping-your-customer-journey/', 'Content': 'For many businesses, more than half of prospective customers have already made up their mind about what they intend to buy before they even recognized the need to buy it, according to our path-to-purchase analyses across a range of industries. Escalent’s recent research guide, \\nWant to Win More? Guide to Boosting Customer Growth Using Our Award-Winning Path-to-Purchase Approach\\n, details how the purchase journey is shorter than you might think … and is getting shorter.\\n\\n\\nThis means that many brands are losing the battle for customers before the sales process even begins. That includes B2B brands and other brands with particularly small and/or more challenging populations. Understanding the path to purchase is imperative there, too.\\n\\n\\nWhat do you do when it’s prohibitive to survey hundreds of participants to power a quantitative path-to-purchase model? Good news.\\n We have found that \\nqualitative research\\n can provide a path-to-purchase strategy of equally high quality when the population you seek is hard to reach or too small for quantitative research. Here’s how we do it:\\n\\n\\nFirst, like any good purchase journey mapping, qualitative research provides the insight needed to ensure all meaningful inflection points are identified. But smart \\npath-to-purchase\\n processes go beyond traditional journey mapping because documenting steps in a path doesn’t lead to actionable results. Escalent does a deep dive into three areas that make a substantial difference for companies: need recognition, awareness and consideration, and path evaluation:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeed recognition: \\nQualitative insights are used to construct trigger profile groups to get a deep understanding of the consumer motivations and pain points of each group, resulting in tailored recommendations for your brand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAwareness and consideration: \\nQualitative findings provide the information needed to understand why your brand is excluded from consideration—and how to fix that—to drive customer growth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPath evaluation:\\n Our qualitative protocol deploys the principles of behavioral science based in consumer decision-making (CDM) literature to uncover and dig into the nonlinear pathways customers follow. This includes uncovering the knowledge to eliminate friction points that inhibit acquisition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCase Study: Financial Services Brands Are Banking on a Better Path-to-Purchase Process\\n\\n\\nWe recently worked with a bank to ensure it would “be there” with the right message at the right moment to attract and retain a specific segment of small business owners for its credit card products. The size and specificity of this audience made it difficult and unrealistic to conduct an effective quantitative survey. As part of this project, we needed to identify, understand and eliminate friction points to direct small business owners’ path to the bank.\\n\\n\\nHere’s what we did: Prior to the discussion, the small business owners completed a shopper journey mapping exercise to get the traditional journey work out of the way quickly. They then sketched their personal timeline of all thoughts and actions, noting the people, resources and emotions for every step. After that, they marked what was difficult, what went well, and where they could have benefitted from more support from the bank.\\n\\n\\nFinding your Unique Path to Purchase Strategy\\n\\n\\nPurchase paths are complex and individualized for different industries; there is not one uniform journey from awareness to consideration to conversion. While many customer journey maps start with the customers and work backward to understand how they came to their final decision, that’s only one of the journeys—most prospective buyers drop out somewhere along the way. To change that outcome, you have to look at consumer behavior at the beginning of the journey to understand all the different decision points that lead buyers to drop out.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to learn more about how Escalent’s qualitative research team can help its clients take action on their path-to-purchase work, even with B2B or other more challenging populations, \\nlet’s connect\\n.

Although the automaker has been offering feature subscriptions (such as a heated steering wheel for £10 a month) in its online store for a while, the heated front seats subscription has sparked backlash in the media and among consumers.\\n\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n\\nShifting from Singular to Micro Transactions with Connected Services\\n\\n\\nAs connected technology continues to advance, automakers are increasingly moving toward building software-defined vehicles (SDV), providing over-the-air (OTA) vehicle software updates, and changing business models to bring in annual recurring revenue (ARR). Offering feature subscriptions that bring in monthly revenue is a significant shift from the singular transaction of buying a car that has characterized the automotive industry for more than a century. This newest feature subscription from BMW reflects the profound disruption that is coming with the connected vehicle revolution, which holds the promise of transforming vehicles into connected devices beyond being means of transportation.\\n\\n\\nBut BMW has been talking about, and rolling out, \\nnew feature subscriptions for years\\n, serving as one industry example of a traditional OEM transforming existing functionality—that has otherwise been built into the vehicle (if desired) for a fixed price during the design phase or has served as selection criterion for used car buyers—into ARR. However, the debate and criticism that have ensued in response to the monthly heated seat subscription highlight how OEMs cannot simply transform current features and functionality into ARR without clearly explaining \\nwhy\\n such a service is advantageous for consumers. With the heated seat subscription, many consumers think to themselves: “The feature is already built into the vehicle, so why do I have to pay AGAIN to have it turned on?”\\n\\n\\nCommunicating the Value of Connectivity Services to Consumers\\n\\n\\nBMW missed the opportunity to build stronger bonds with consumers by communicating the long-term value of such an offer for customers. Instead, the lack of transparency and explanation resulted in consumers reacting negatively because it looks like BMW is now asking customers to pay a recurring monthly fee for a feature that was otherwise built into the vehicle.\\n\\n\\nThere have been similar negative reactions to GM. Since the beginning of June, customers who purchase a new GMC or Buick must also pay $1,500 for an \\nOnStar and Connected Services Premium Plan\\n that is listed as an option but incorporated into the vehicle as a standard feature that cannot be removed. Similar to BMW, this new connected service puzzles and frustrates consumers, who see it primarily as a way for GM to raise prices by mandating customers pay for an option that isn’t really an option when purchasing the car.\\n\\n\\nMoving consumers to subscription models will take time and education. Transparency will be essential to help consumers adapt to this shifting landscape that is moving from a single transaction to ongoing micro-transactions. This will require OEMs and tech partners to have a deep understanding of consumer needs and values relative to connected vehicle ecosystems. Automakers also need to establish marketing plans and messaging that focus on clearly communicating the rationale and benefits behind new connected service offerings.\\n\\n\\nHailing the Rise of Digital Vehicle Personalization\\n\\n\\nThe connected vehicle revolution is ushering in a burgeoning era of digital vehicle personalization, which is akin to the smartphone market today. Consider, for example, when a consumer buys a smartphone. There are only a certain, fixed number of models available for purchase; however, there are hundreds of millions of personalized smartphones in the world because smartphones are designed to make the ease of personalization seamless.\\n\\n\\nThis is the way of the future for connected vehicles—software-defined vehicle functionality and feature subscriptions create a more individualized experience for how people own and use vehicles. It gives consumers the ability to personalize a vehicle beyond the initial build based on the exact functionality a customer wants or doesn’t want at any given moment. Additionally, new features and functionality can continue rolling out via OTA updates to further tailor and improve the user experience as desired in real time. Altogether, this makes for a win-win situation wherein customers are given extreme versatility in how they use and experience vehicles while automakers receive ARR not just from the initial vehicle buyer but from subsequent owners as well.\\n\\n\\nDelivering Connected Vehicle Value and Remaining Competitive\\n\\n\\nTo stay competitive as the industry continues evolving, automotive players need to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate connected vehicle services that consumers consider beneficial and see value in.\\n\\n\\nClearly explain why connected service subscriptions are valuable for consumers as well as the business itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsumers today are savvy and well-researched and seek authentic brands that communicate with honesty. They are capable of understanding why a company is making business changes to stay relevant and, above all else, provide greater value to its customers—if the brand in question keeps the value for consumers as its North Star and communicates openly.\\n\\n\\nIf you need help identifying what types of connected vehicle services consumers would value, optimizing your product innovation strategy or evaluating your communication plan, our \\nAutomotive & Mobility\\n team can help.

Without the time to address BEV concerns (such as misconceptions around day-to-day ownership costs, rebates/incentives and charging), shoppers without prior BEV exposure tend to default to what they know—internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. As a result, BEV consideration appears restricted to those who have done their research ahead of time, drastically reducing the chances that a BEV will make the short list for a spontaneous shopper.\\n\\n\\nTo tap into new consumer bases, automakers need to reach and influence consumers long before their new-vehicle shopping journey begins. This includes marketing BEVs well in advance of production and reinforcing how BEVs are a reliable, cost-effective and convenient choice.\\n\\n\\nClosing the Gap Between Expectations and Reality\\n\\n\\nOwning a BEV is easier than many expect, but that lesson is slow to permeate the broader market. While 54% of non-BEV shoppers expect owning a BEV to be more complicated than owning an ICE vehicle, half of current BEV owners report that owning a BEV is actually easier than their initial expectations, and only 7% say it is more difficult. This perception that owning a BEV will be more complicated and challenging than an ICE vehicle is a big emotional barrier for consumers that automakers need to resolve—ideally, before the shopping process even begins so consumers will include a BEV in their initial consideration set when they do start shopping for a new vehicle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ease of home charging, the convenience of not having to visit a gas station, and a reduced need for regular maintenance are all compelling points in favor of BEVs around the ease of day-to-day ownership. Automakers should also focus on assuaging fears around vehicle longevity—such as emphasizing that BEV powertrain warranties protect against severe battery degradation for 10 years or 100,000 miles.\\n\\n\\nUtility companies equally have a unique opportunity to connect with consumers before and throughout the BEV shopping journey. Only 16% of BEV owners report speaking to their utility company about their electricity rates ahead of purchase—highlighting a missed opportunity to illustrate the realities of BEV ownership to potential future buyers.\\n\\n\\nTo bring more shoppers into the fold, utility companies should be proactive in helping potential owners understand how to “fuel” their vehicle at home, in public, and on road trips, as well as in demonstrating that the charging infrastructure is already widespread.\\n\\n\\nLeveraging Consumer Loyalty\\n\\n\\nWhile BEV-specific education paints a part of the picture, automakers can also capitalize on existing brand exposure and loyalty. Many car buyers learned about their current vehicle because they previously owned the same make or model. Reusing name plates or offering vehicles with various powertrains—ICE, hybrid and BEV—can create a sense of familiarity and help consumers overcome BEV hesitation.\\n\\n\\nWord of mouth presents a huge opportunity, too—88% of BEV owners report knowing at least a few other BEV owners prior to purchase, which is in stark contrast to the 62% of non-BEV shoppers who said nobody they know owned a BEV. Between not knowing anyone with a BEV and having little-to-no other form of exposure to BEVs, it is easy to understand why non-BEV shoppers don’t include BEVs in their initial consideration set. Instead, these shoppers are on auto-pilot for the drivetrain they’ve always bought: ICE.\\n\\n\\nAs such, tapping into personal relationships through “ambassador programs” can boost visibility and enthusiasm while helping to counter and shift misconceptions around the cost and hassle of owning BEVs. Non-BEV shoppers need to be shown that owning a BEV can be an easier proposition than many expect, and who better to show them than BEV owners themselves?\\n\\n\\nCreating More BEV “Wins”\\n\\n\\nConsumers with little to no exposure to BEVs typically go into the car buying process thinking that BEVs are not a convenient or cost-effective option to consider. Because of the speed at which non-BEV shoppers commit to a vehicle, opportunities to address concerns before the point of sale are limited.\\n\\n\\nAdvertising, public relations and exposure to BEV owners all have a role to play in paving the way for widespread BEV consideration and adoption. Automakers must use multiple avenues to educate their audience on the benefits of BEV ownership so that by the time consumers begin actively shopping, they’re already sold on the advantages of a BEV.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about EVForward and how we can help you tailor your strategy to better reach future BEV buyers, send us a note by clicking the button below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout EVForward™\\n\\n\\nThe EVForward Path to Purchase DeepDive was conducted among a national sample of 1,374 respondents, including 118 BEV owners, 248 BEV shoppers (shopped for but have never owned a BEV) and 1,008 non-BEV shoppers (haven’t shopped for and haven’t owned a BEV) from February 16 to March 6, 2022.

Many of the same principles apply. Dominating key territories. Anticipating your competitors’ moves. Knowing when to attack. When to hold and fortify your position.\\n\\n\\nBut there’s more at stake in the boardroom than in the board game. In boardrooms, wargames drive real-world decisions. A well-run wargame helps teams assess the competitive battlefield, refine strategy, plan operations and execute effectively. Game designs and techniques vary, but wargaming workshops share a common goal—bringing teams together around simulated situations to prepare for different scenarios, threats and opportunities.\\n\\n\\nWe sat down with the Competitive Intelligence Manager for a top consumer appliances brand to better understand the role of competitive intelligence in wargames and why team-based simulations lead to better decision-making.\\n\\n\\nIngredients for a successful wargaming workshop\\n\\n\\nWhat is the value of wargaming?\\n\\n\\nWargaming is an opportunity to get the right people in a room to do problem solving as a reaction to, or a prevention of, something important happening in the market. It is an opportunity to step away from our daily roles, to allow teams to look at things from different angles, to get different opinions and debates going. \\n\\n\\nIt sounds like there’s a lot of value to team dynamics in a wargaming workshop.\\n\\n\\nYes, absolutely. If you were to try to get the output of a wargame without a proper wargame workshop, it would take you much longer, it would be a lot less collaborative and ultimately less effective.\\n\\n\\nTell us more about the output of a wargaming workshop.\\n\\n\\nThe output for me is a clear joined-up direction, an agreed-upon approach that the company needs to take as a reaction to an event or in case a scenario unfolds.\\n\\n\\nCan you give any business wargaming examples?\\n\\n\\nSure. In one case, we realized there was a white space in the market and one of our competitors was taking advantage of it by launching a new product. We wanted to determine how to best react. We created a series of actions to be ready, both before and after the potential launch of our competitor’s product. We looked at how we would change our marketing, pricing and messaging to react to it. In the end, we were right. The competitor launched that product several weeks later—our reaction was immediate, as we had already decided what to do and we were able to defend our market share.\\n\\n\\nSo competitive insights are key?\\n\\n\\nYes. A wargame workshop should be organized for any significant event that is impacting or will impact your market. It could be a reaction to a threat that your competitor has already made—a ‘reactive’ wargame—or it could be in anticipation of a potential disruption that might or might not happen—a ‘proactive’ wargame. You need robust competitive intelligence. Then you get those different viewpoints in the room and formulate a unified response.\\n\\n\\nWhat goes into effective business wargaming?\\n\\n\\nOf course, you need the right people in the room. I always try to include people from different parts of the business who have different perspectives and bring different capabilities to the table. \\n\\n\\nSecond, all participants should be working from the same playbook, with a shared set of knowledge of the topic. This is a critical ingredient. And this is where competitive intelligence research comes in. \\n\\n\\nSounds like it is important to start with a shared baseline of competitive intelligence.\\n\\n\\nAbsolutely. It’s essential to have a ‘central point’ of competitive insight. A playbook. And creating a playbook is not just about gathering information. Participants want concise, easy-to-read playbooks, designed for our specific wargame objectives. \\n\\n\\nWhat’s in a wargame playbook?\\n\\n\\nI can’t reveal secrets! But generally speaking, there’s an overview of market dynamics. Often there are deeper dives into competitors—financials and business performance, current product portfolio, pricing information and strategy, technology development and innovation, their marketing, distribution and manufacturing strategy, as well as their people and organization. Sometimes we need to go deeper into specific competitive products. What are the features, value proposition, product claims, pricing? What’s the go-to-market strategy? \\n\\n\\nA good wargame playbook is more than a collection of data about your competitors. It should convert data and information into actionable competitive intelligence that we can use for effective scenario planning.\\n\\n\\nHow to build an effective wargame playbook\\n\\n\\nEscalent creates custom playbooks based on our clients’ specific industry challenges and business objectives. There’s no one-size-fits-all. However, we start with general guidelines. Here are some typical questions we answer for our clients.\\n\\n\\nOverview of the market and competitive dynamics\\n\\n\\nWho are the main players? Emerging and adjacent players?

Fast forward to today. Traditional parameters of ‘the competition’ no longer hold. Barriers to entry are lower, nimble start-ups are popping up daily and market dominators from adjacent industries can suddenly become direct competitors.\\n\\n\\nInnovation and disruptive technologies have blurred the boundaries between industries. Competitive Intelligence (CI) leaders—and those who rely on CI to make critical business decisions—need more eyes on more players in more places, and a more comprehensive approach to competitive monitoring.\\n\\n\\nHere’s a look at five ways competition can come from anywhere and how holistic competitive intelligence can help you defend market share and spot opportunities for growth across a broadening competitive landscape.\\n\\n\\nCompetitive Insight #1: Tech juggernauts will continue to break through industry boundaries\\n\\n\\nYour Apple Watch. Is it a communication device or a wellness device? The answer is both (and other things to boot). Your Airpods amplify sounds through ‘live listen,’ effectively acting as a basic hearing aid. And several other technology companies have versions of wellness wearables that track everything from stress levels to sweat levels.\\n\\n\\nGoogle has entered the travel business with Google Travel and is posing a significant threat to online booking companies. As Google integrates more features like maps and calendars, it is only a matter of time before this tech behemoth becomes a major player within the travel and tourism ecosystem.\\n\\n\\nTakeaway:\\n\\n\\nYour next competitor could be an Apple, a Google, or a technology start-up that’s barely on the radar. Brands need a disciplined approach to tracking innovations that have the potential to disrupt business across multiple and overlapping industries. A CI program that tracks innovation can shine a spotlight on a range of possibilities at play and act as your early warning system. And an innovation-focused CI program means doing more than just thinking broadly about the tech firms that may start playing in your space. It can also mean scanning patent applications and hiring patterns to understand who’s investing in your backyard.\\n\\n\\nCompetitive Insight #2: Companies that are data-rich are competitive threats to anyone\\n\\n\\nWith core competencies in data collection and management, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), companies that sit on mounds of data could be coming for anyone’s lunch. Data is the foundation of all AI and those who own the data own an enormous competitive advantage.\\n\\n\\nTake, for example, the adoption of AI and ML in the beauty and personal care sector. Brands are now able to deliver DNA-based skincare, providing bespoke products based on genetic makeup. Beauty brands such as Volition Beauty and Glossier are even leveraging their consumer data to create, test and market products in half the usual time-to-market.\\n\\n\\nAnd think about TikTok. Beauty and skincare brands are all over TikTok. It’s been an incredibly effective platform for the category. But while beauty brands, both big and small, are running wildly successful influencer campaigns, TikTok is accumulating valuable user data. What’s to prevent TikTok from entering the custom beauty business? It may sound farfetched, but consider \\nAmazon’s private label strategy\\n which has been a thorn in the side of its channel partners. Especially in FMCG, today’s channel friend can also become tomorrow’s market foe.\\n\\n\\nTakeaway:\\n\\n\\nWith AI and ML impacting nearly every vertical, it is critical to be prepared. Consider updating the list of players you track based on similarities in data gathering and usage patterns. Keep tabs on technology companies that you may currently rely on \\nfor\\n data, or as a channel partner. They may be your next competitor.\\n\\n\\nCompetitive Insight #3: Connected technologies are creating new ecosystems and new conditions for competition\\n\\n\\nWhat happens when everything is connected? What are the implications when new ecosystems are created?\\n\\n\\nIn recent years, we’ve seen first-hand how seemingly small innovations can change the fate of entire industries. Consider automotive. For decades, it was dominated by a handful of players, with no big change in the way products were created, manufactured or sold. Today’s auto industry competes in a far more complex landscape, connected with new OEMs and energy companies, EV infrastructure and more.\\n\\n\\nThis is happening in the financial sector too. As more global consumers adopt QR codes, the payment industry must brace for change. QR technology has been a boon to the unbanked in emerging markets and an ultra-convenience for anyone with a smartphone. In India, local governments are rewarding merchants for QR adoption, threatening the longstanding dominance of Visa and Mastercard in the region. PayTM in India and UALA in LatAm are digitally native players that started as digital wallets. Now they are fast turning into financial super apps, providing a whole gamut of financial products and even ecommerce.\\n\\n\\nTakeaway:\\n\\n\\nKeep an eye on the big picture. New ecosystems are rich with possibilities. Competitive intelligence is not only about scouting for threats and the unexpected; it is also about exploring areas for new partnerships. A good CI program should support partner scouting, M&A and product innovation teams.\\n\\n\\nCompetitive Insight #4: Keep an eye on the big fish\\n\\n\\nCovid restrictions may have fueled Netflix’s growth in 2020. But today, with rising inflation and recession worries, more consumers are choosing \\nbetween\\n multiple streaming subscription services. Netflix had long been at the top of the OTT sector and was considered ‘unbeatable.’ Until recently.\\n\\n\\nWhile Amazon Prime and Hulu have been nipping at their heels, the more recent challenge to Netflix has come from legacy media companies, the likes of Paramount, Disney, Peacock (NBC) and HBO who have made significant forays into the streaming space.\\n\\n\\nTakeaway:\\n\\n\\nBig fish can flounder, but don’t count them out. In this case, while major media companies may have missed the initial lockdown boon for streaming services, they’re back. And taking a bite out of Netflix. The lesson: successful CI programs should not be restricted to the usual suspects, i.e. your current competitors. Keep an eye on strategic and tactical changes brewing, whether that means up-and-coming challengers to your market share or the market leaders you thought were sleeping.\\n\\n\\nCompetitive Insight #5: Even in highly saturated markets, white spaces appear\\n\\n\\nCustomers expect faster shipping times for everything. The early days of the pandemic may have fueled demand for online grocery delivery, but now many shoppers have a permanent need for speed. In European markets, over a dozen new companies have emerged to fulfill instant needs, including Gopuff, JOKR and Zapp.\\n\\n\\nQuick commerce (q-commerce) is the next evolution of ecommerce. Q-commerce is pushing traditional ecommerce players into the logistics game. Many are evolving their operations by directly sourcing products, hiring their own delivery staff, building micro-fulfillment centers and dark stores, and seeking partnerships. For example, Carrefour has partnered with Uber Eats in France to make grocery deliveries to people’s homes in under 20 minutes across 100-plus French cities.\\n\\n\\nTakeaway:\\n\\n\\nThe rapid rise of q-commerce shows even ecommerce heavyweights can be caught on the back foot. Even in the most saturated of markets, white space opportunities emerge, often driven by consumer needs (in this case, the need for toilet paper in a pandemic). Competitive intelligence and monitoring consumer trends go hand-in-hand. Competitive monitoring should be done in the context of consumer behavior, cultural shifts and global change.\\n\\n\\nComplex competitive dynamics call for advanced competitive intelligence research\\n\\n\\nCompetition can come from anywhere\\n. Luckily, so can competitive intelligence.

That finding comes from our most recent \\nEVForward™\\n report, part of the largest and most comprehensive study of the next generation of electric vehicle buyers.\\n\\n\\nIn what is sure to raise some eyebrows, the report found that the preference for legacy automakers extends across the EV brand landscape. While EV innovator and standard-setter Tesla has a significant amount of consumer mindshare, that mindshare doesn’t translate into a preference to purchase a Tesla vehicle.\\n\\n\\nMore than one-third (35%) of survey respondents indicate a preference for purchasing from a well-established automaker, while just under one-quarter (24%) indicate they’d likely look to an EV specialist to purchase their first electric vehicle. A further 41% of the study’s participants are undecided, highlighting the stakes at play for familiar brands and startups seeking to capitalize on rising waves of EV interest among consumers.\\n\\n\\nWhile brands such as Tesla and Rivian have captured headlines and carved out market space for themselves in the fast-growing EV industry, maintaining that space going forward is likely to be a trickier proposition in an industry dominated by companies that have decades of experience in making cars. Established automotive brands have currency with consumers, who have recognized the strides those brands have taken to improve and refine their electric offerings. As the selection of EVs from traditional automakers continues to expand—and performance and features continue to improve—newer players could find themselves in an increasingly competitive space.\\n\\n\\nWhile the consumer trust and familiarity enjoyed by traditional automakers have positioned them advantageously, winning over future EV buyers will ultimately depend on the ability to deliver features and traits that EV buyers are looking for. The study found that when it comes to living up to consumers’ expectations and preferences in that regard, automakers of all sizes and tenures have ground to make up.\\n\\n\\nThe top five brand attributes consumers want from an EV are:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDependable, lasts a long time (44% of respondents)\\n\\n\\nGood value for money (42%)\\n\\n\\nLatest safety technologies (40%)\\n\\n\\nInexpensive to maintain (38%)\\n\\n\\nInnovative features and technologies (37%)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe current crop of EV offerings falls short when it comes to meeting these expectations, however. Just 5%–31% of respondents report they feel like \\nany \\nautomaker is delivering on any of these five areas with their electrified offerings.\\n\\n\\nIt’s especially noteworthy that EV shoppers who have long prioritized cutting-edge innovation and safety technologies have now added longevity and dependability to that list of priorities. Dependability, value, and low maintenance costs rank highly as key attributes automakers must offer and may reflect shoppers’ preference to purchase from an automaker they already trust.\\n\\n\\nGoing forward, both traditional automakers and EV startups would be wise to revisit design, engineering, and marketing priorities with an eye toward bolstering confidence in consumers looking for an electric vehicle that will serve their needs for years to come. Automakers that can do so successfully will greatly improve their chances of winning over the still substantial subset of EV shoppers who are undecided about the type of company from which they would consider purchasing an EV.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about EVForward™ and how we can help you tailor your EV strategy with EV consumer insights you cannot find anywhere else in the market, send us a note by clicking the button below.'}\n","{'Index': 47, 'Heading': 'Plans for Strategic Fleet Technology Investments Shift Into Neutral', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/plans-for-strategic-fleet-technology-investments-shift-into-neutral/', 'Content': 'From electric vehicles to telematics, fleet decision-makers are scaling back new technology adoption in response to an uncertain economy\\n\\n\\nMore than two years after the onset of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses around the world are grappling with continuing supply chain constraints. In technology and manufacturing, chip shortages and rising freight costs are forcing companies to come to grips with a “new normal” that shows few signs of abating—in some cases, causing business leaders to reassess their whole approach to doing business.\\n\\n\\nHowever, few corners of industry have been impacted by these ongoing challenges like the commercial vehicle and fleet sector. For many fleet decision-makers, daily operations have been completely flipped on their head as they struggle to find efficiencies and continue to turn a profit in a chaotic economic environment.\\n\\n\\nThat’s why the findings of our 2022 Fleet Technology Index (FTI) report—which provides an annual snapshot of market readiness and the expectation for adoption of eight emerging and transformative technologies among our \\nFleet Advisory Hub\\nTM\\n audience—are not surprising.\\n\\n\\nAcross the board, fleet owners and operators are pumping the brakes on their expectations for near-term adoption of data analytics, telematics, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), autonomous vehicles (AVs), artificial intelligence, drones, mobility service, and blockchain technology. Despite the real and tangible benefits many of these technologies are already offering fleets that have integrated them, decision-makers are wary of making significant strategic investments in a business environment that requires them to focus on their profit margins near daily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, it’s not all bad news.\\n\\n\\nDespite the regression of index scores following significant growth in 2020, confidence remains high that each of these eight technologies has a place in the fleet of the future. For each technology, the FTI score for 2021 remained higher than what we initially recorded in 2019—before the pandemic was something we could have even imagined. This bodes well for the eventual adoption of technologies that, when fully implemented, promise to reinvent what is possible for fleets and their customers.\\n\\n\\nIn the meantime, automotive manufacturers and service providers seeking to scale adoption of their offerings must first understand and acknowledge the environment they—and their desired fleet customers—currently face, and work to demonstrate the immediate benefits adopters can reap. Additionally, finding ways to offset up-front costs will be critical to convincing fleet decision-makers who are worried about their bottom line today rather than what their fleet makeup will look like three years from now.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about the Fleet Technology Index or how our team can help you better understand the landscape of commercial vehicle and fleet technology adoption, click the button below to send us a message.'}\n","{'Index': 48, 'Heading': 'Big Data, Small Fleets—Scaling Connected Vehicle Services Down to Suit the Needs of Fleets of All Sizes', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/big-data-small-fleets-scaling-connected-vehicle-services-down-to-suit-the-needs-of-fleets-of-all-sizes/', 'Content': 'When the automotive industry grapples with the emergence of a hot new technology, some of the earliest questions posed by product planners, engineers and journalists are about scale. Cracking the code for widespread adoption has been a difficult feat for generations. Surely, these are familiar refrains: \\nHow quickly can an old guard monolith transition to adopt? Just how fast can a start-up upscale its production to take a bite of market share?\\n\\n\\nThat’s why it’s so unique that the path to growth for connected vehicle data services is to scale \\ndown\\n.\\n\\n\\nConnected vehicle data services (CVDS) are defined as software and platforms that provide fleet operators a resource to manage their data from their vehicles in the field and related business operations. According to our latest \\nFleet Advisory Hub\\nTM\\n report, these products have exploded in popularity among fleets with at least 500 vehicles. And that growth is easy enough to understand—the ease of implementation and economies of scale at play mean managers of large fleets get incredible returns for every dollar spent on a data service.\\n\\n\\nHowever, fleets of that size make up a tiny fraction of the fleet industry as a whole, representing just 2% of the Fleet Advisory Hub audience.\\n\\n\\nTo continue their growth path, CVDS providers must find ways to demonstrate value to the men and women who operate and manage the other 98% of fleets in the United States. Those include micro fleets (managing 1–5 vehicles), small fleets (6–50) and medium fleets (51–499). Our research shows an astounding 80% of large fleets have adopted CVDS of some kind, while just a fraction of the other segments have done so. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t interest—more than half of small and micro fleets are actively shopping for such services, offering a ripe opportunity for CVDS providers.\\n\\n\\nSo, the name of the game will be scaling down the value proposition to meet the pain points of smaller fleets. If CVDS providers can demonstrate value to fleet operators with fewer vehicles over which to diffuse the cost of implementation and ongoing service, they’ll be able to seize on that high degree of interest. One path is showing the various ways collected data can be put to work to save the fleet time and money—even with the help of a third party.\\n\\n\\nAmong fleets currently using CVDS offerings, 85% are sharing with external partners. Common sharing opportunities include providing vehicle telematics data to insurance providers to enable usage-based insurance, or to fleet management companies for a more comprehensive view of the vehicle life cycle. These implementations address unique challenges for small fleets and show how data can drive the solutions.\\n\\n\\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive at face value, CVDS companies must find ways to scale down their offerings to scale up their businesses.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about the ways large fleets are successfully deploying CVDS and how to overcome barriers to adoption for smaller fleets, send a note to our Fleet Advisory Hub team.'}\n","{'Index': 49, 'Heading': 'Increasingly Polarized Political Climate Threatens Widespread EV Adoption', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/increasingly-polarized-political-climate-threatens-widespread-ev-adoption/', 'Content': 'By all measures available to the casual observer, 2021 was a banner year for the advancement of electric vehicles (EVs). Across the automotive spectrum, EVs dominated headlines and attention—from President Joe Biden driving an electrified American icon in the Ford F-150 Lightning, to the debut of the stunning Audi e-tron GT, a truly aspirational luxury sedan with a fully electric powertrain. And sales were rapid, nearly doubling their pace—it took just over six months of EV sales in 2021 to eclipse the total sales volume for all of 2020.\\n\\n\\nBut beneath the surface, the story is not quite so rosy. The automotive industry continues to grapple with a global chip shortage that is likely to get worse before it gets better, tamping down the industry’s ability to build and sell all kinds of vehicles, especially EVs—meaning even pre-orders for vehicles set to be delivered months or years down the road sell out in just minutes. Subsequent low inventory concerns have led to customer perceptions of a high-demand, low-supply market that favors dealers and sellers, causing many to put off shopping for cars altogether. Further, major misconceptions about the capabilities of EVs persist, leaving many would-be buyers to not seriously consider EVs from the start.\\n\\n\\nBut one trend, in particular, threatens the hopes many have for widespread EV adoption—an increasingly polarized political landscape that has turned solutions to climate change, such as electrified cars and alternative energy sources, into toxic propositions among conservatives.\\n\\n\\nAs part of our latest \\nEVForward\\nTM\\n market profile report, conducted in mid-2021, we found some surprising figures. For the first time since we launched EVForward\\xa0in 2019, opinion and sentiment regarding EVs fell:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe number of participants who see EVs as a “passing fad” or “stupid idea” grew five percentage points, from 13% in past reports to 18% in 2021. Similarly, those perceiving EVs as “the future” or “an interesting idea” fell five percentage points, from 87% to 82%.\\n\\n\\nWhile liberals’ responses remain consistent with those from past surveys, conservatives drive the drop in sentiment—with a 7% shift from positive to negative sentiment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ongoing national political debate about the impact of and solutions to climate change ramped up in a big way following the inauguration of President Biden, who appealed to the progressive wing of the Democratic party by supporting the concept of a “Green New Deal” (expanded federal spending to boost green and alternative energy production) as well as investments in new technologies to reduce the use of fossil fuels, including EVs. When paired with the significant uptick in EV marketing observed nationally in 2021, particularly by legacy automakers with household names, the legislative conversation put EVs on the radar of shoppers in a new way and reached those who were previously unfamiliar with the technology.\\n\\n\\nWhile sentiment and opinion dipped in our latest report, familiarity and exposure both rose. Respondents who indicated they “know EVs well” inched up by 2%, while those who had exposure to EV owners increased by 5% to 31% of all respondents. Automakers must now ask themselves a stark question—is there a large (and growing) segment of “unwinnable” shoppers who will not turn to EVs no matter how good or comparable they are to traditional gas-powered cars?\\n\\n\\nIn order to get ahead of that looming question, automakers need to find engaging ways to upend these misconceptions—new and old—among conservatives, who represent an increasingly aware, familiar and skeptical audience. At the same time, automakers must be wary of causing conservatives to feel they are having EVs forced upon them.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about the latest EVForward market report insights and the misconceptions that EV makers must combat, connect with our \\nAutomotive & Mobility\\n team by sending us a note today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout EVForward™\\n\\n\\nThe EVForward mid-year market profile report was conducted among a national sample of 5,005 respondents between July 14 and August 9, 2021.

Our latest \\nFleet Advisory Hub\\nTM\\n research shows 57% of fleet decision-makers plan to replace their vehicles in the next three years—and an overwhelming majority of those (65%) are proactively shopping for EV solutions. Ramping up fleet usage is one of the pivotal cogs to spurring broader consumer adoption of EVs, thanks to the power of observability. This is a high-stakes competition, and winning won’t be easy.\\n\\n\\nFor fleet owners and operators, forming an EV strategy is about much more than just the quality or capability of the vehicle itself. A host of factors are at play when commercially operating any vehicle—from cost to own and operate, to ways to maximize uptime or minimize downtime. These considerations can be the difference between success and failure of the business.\\n\\n\\nFirst, fleet decision-makers eyeing EVs must consider the costs associated with adopting charging platforms alongside their newly minted and electrified fleet. Such technology requires a heavy up-front cost to purchase and potentially long-term maintenance costs to preserve or replace the technology over time.\\n\\n\\nOur latest Fleet Advisory Hub study indicates paying for charging solutions tops their list of fleet decision-maker concerns:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n82% of adopters finance their private charging infrastructure and 68% of shoppers expect to\\n\\n\\n32% of adopters report higher-than-expected private charging infrastructure costs\\n\\n\\n29% of fleets allow employees to take and store vehicles at home, adding another layer of complexity for implementing a robust charging infrastructure\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFleet decision-makers must also grapple with unique use cases. Chief concerns include availability—or lack thereof—of public chargers and the inherent downtime associated with charging, especially compared to the ubiquity and immediacy of gas stations for most fleet drivers. The reliability of available gas stations is a big deal for many fleets, considering more than half (57%) of decision-makers operate fleets with variable routing patterns—a model that would require extensive usage data to ensure the smooth rollout of a viable electrified vehicle program.\\n\\n\\nFleet decision-makers know these are significant hurdles and, to date, there is only a limited ecosystem of information and tools to work around them. Our study found that 42% of operators recognize these unique EV factors, however, they are not familiar enough with them to calculate their impact on the ever-critical total cost of ownership (TCO). This is extremely important for automakers and charging technology providers alike—according to a \\nrecent Fleet Advisory Hub™ study\\n, total cost of ownership (TCO) is a leading factor influencing a fleet decision-makers’ adoption decisions.\\n\\n\\nElectrified product manufacturers and service providers must take a close look at these concerns—most of which have little to do with EVs themselves—and recognize the importance of addressing them in ways that cater to unique applications. A one-size-fits-all approach can’t, and won’t, inspire adoption of EV applications for fleets—further, it could cause frustration and defection from the technology or specific brands.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more or if you have questions, click the button below to send us a note today.'}\n","{'Index': 51, 'Heading': 'Europeans Are Open to Electric Vehicles, But They Still Aren’t Buying Them', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/europeans-are-open-to-electric-vehicles-but-they-still-arent-buying-them/', 'Content': 'Automakers’ One-Size-Fits-All Approach to Merchandising Electric Vehicles Won’t Increase Adoption\\n\\n\\nMore than 80% of new-car buyers in Europe are open to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), but only 12% expect to actually purchase one as their next car.\\n\\n\\nThese stark numbers, uncovered as part of our \\nmost recent EVForward\\nTM\\n study\\n, are disappointing for automakers around the world that have increasingly focused their marketing efforts on promoting electric vehicles (EVs) to drive adoption.

This key performance indicator (KPI) is used to track, trend and drive improvement in customer experience over time. It has come in and out of vogue, and can be polarizing in its adoption.\\n\\n\\nNPS Is Not A One-Size-Fits-All Approach\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I don’t believe NPS accurately represents a consumer’s holistic relationship with a brand. Asking if someone would recommend a company, product or service is typically the sole question that produces the NPS—but the answer does not inherently mean the resulting NPS represents someone’s entire experience. In some cases, NPS is measuring the first and only experience or just the most recent interaction with the brand. One interaction will not erase a lifetime of good ones, but it may signal a change in the customer experience or signal a potential flight risk. It also doesn’t take into account \\nwho\\n the survey participant would recommend or \\nwhy\\n.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, many organizations use NPS as a one-size-fits-all approach to measuring brand health, but very rarely does a customer journey flow in such a way that it should be the default metric. There are some instances where it just may not make sense for the audience, product or interaction/touchpoint being measured in the survey.\\n\\n\\nExamples of When NPS Is Not Enough\\n\\n\\nTo illustrate what I mean, let’s first consider employee engagement surveys. Asking employees if they would recommend their employer to others assumes they know people who do similar work or they would enjoy working with peers in their friend group. Similar questions occur in B2B customer surveys: for specific equipment, software, or other business needs, asking if the survey participant would recommend the brand assumes the individual knows others for whom the brand is relevant. The problem with this type of question in all of these scenarios is that NPS is more so measuring whether the survey participant is networked with others in the same industry, not whether his or her relationship with the brand is healthy. The end result for the blanket approach use of this metric will likely be poorly-informed business decisions that could potentially have negative impacts on the customers, employees or business functions it illuminates.\\n\\n\\nAs another example, let’s consider the customer of a CVS-like brand who is an avid patron of both the pharmacy and convenience store. She gets the “full” experience of what the brand has to offer and is a perfect candidate for a brand health survey. In the survey, the instructions tell her to only think about the pharmacy while answering the NPS question. Little does the survey know that her particular CVS has been understaffed. As a result, the store’s shelves are generally a mess and there are long lines for the cashier. Independent of that, she receives impeccable service in the pharmacy. This leads to an internal struggle when answering the survey. Her desire to give the survey a good rating conflicts with her experience in other areas of the store. She ultimately rates the store lower than she would have if she had only been thinking of the pharmacy.\\n\\n\\nIt is incredibly hard for people to forget recent interactions and answer questions objectively. In this scenario, if enough survey participants answer in a similar fashion as our customer, the brand is likely to draw the wrong conclusions from the results. It may focus on improving the pharmacy, whereas the real problem is customer experience in the rest of the store.

Brands big and small, established and startups, are racing to shout their commitments to a sustainable future from the mountaintops to win over buyers and investors, touting fully electrified product lineups and “net zero” manufacturing practices.\\n\\n\\nNow, those commitments are being noticed by fleet decision-makers.\\n\\n\\nIn our latest \\nFleet Advisory Hub\\nTM\\n study, \\nFleet Electrification & The Evolving Brand Landscape\\n, we asked fleet decision-makers to evaluate selected brands across four key metrics: familiarity, positive opinion, consideration and leadership.\\n\\n\\nFord and Tesla Stand Out\\n\\n\\nAmong light duty fleet operators, a clear trend emerged: these decision-makers are keenly tuned into the activities of legacy car manufacturers, including Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, GMC, Nissan, RAM and Chrysler. However, when asked about nascent car makers—which included the likes of Rivian, Lucid, Lordstown and Canoo—only Tesla was able to compete with the “old guard,” and theirs was a strong showing.\\n\\n\\nLight Duty Brand Funnel Metrics\\n\\n\\nWhile Ford is at the head of the pack among light duty fleet decision-makers when it comes to familiarity, the blue oval is joined by Toyota for positive opinion and consideration, where the lead over Tesla is narrower. Further, Tesla’s years of retail market EV supremacy are paying off. Fleet decision-makers overwhelmingly point to Elon Musk’s brand as the “absolute leader” in the space, a position that boosts Tesla’s performance in other categories when compared to other, lesser-known startups.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLight duty startups have a big hill to climb to catch up to established automakers, but one critical avenue is clear: they must take a bite out of Tesla’s leadership “mind share” to forge a path to success. By getting their vehicles on the road and showing what they’re capable of—particularly in the context of the needs of fleet decision-makers—there’s still a chance for light duty startups to establish a foothold and gain ground by raising brand awareness and familiarity.\\n\\n\\nBigger Trucks, Bigger Competition\\n\\n\\nOn the medium and heavy duty side of the fleet world, Ford leads again—including for familiarity, positive opinion and consideration—while Tesla continues to edge out the rest of the crowd in leadership. However, what’s most interesting in this segment is the parity from top to bottom, particularly compared to the light duty market.\\n\\n\\nMedium and Heavy Duty Brand Funnel Metrics\\n\\n\\nFord and Tesla both give up ground to the rest of the field from top to bottom, as medium and heavy duty fleet decision-makers indicate higher familiarity, positive opinion and consideration for each of the eleven other brands—including the five startups evaluated. While Tesla’s consumer products have left an impression on those evaluating light duty options, that leadership position is not as pronounced among medium and heavy duty decision-makers, who have yet to face daily exposure to tangible products that address their real-world needs. Tesla still holds the lead, but the field is a bit more wide open.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe door is open for startups such as Nikola, Rivian, BYD, Brightdrop and Arrival to make inroads among these key constituents, but they’ll need to act fast—and boldly—to gain ground on established medium and heavy duty brands entering the EV arena.\\n\\n\\nGrowing Out & Sizing Up\\n\\n\\nAs the automotive landscape continues to evolve, so, too, will the opinions of fleet decision-makers. Legacy automakers and startups alike must find ways to demonstrate their respective benefits, albeit in different ways. The names with which we are all familiar can’t rest on their laurels—they must show they have the capability and agility to manufacture the vehicles they’re known for with reliable electric powertrains.

Some may remember GPS in its infancy when users would print MapQuest directions from their computers before setting off on a trip. Those of a certain age will also remember unfolding and squinting at their trusty paper maps while trying to locate a current location and a planned destination.\\n\\n\\nOf course, navigation is much easier now. When I need to get to a new location, I pull up Google Maps or Waze on my phone, and they instantly find the most direct route, the miles I need to travel, and the duration of my trip. Voice directions allow me to keep my eyes on the road while still be alerted about the turns and exits I need to take. And when there is an accident and traffic has come to a standstill, today’s GPS can inform me of the best ways to circumvent the problem and get me on my way. So, in what ways have I benefited from GPS? It’s offered fast, easy, and effective directions on the fly while limiting the number of opportunities to get lost. Without a doubt, GPS has proven invaluable in getting me from Point A to Point B.\\n\\n\\nAnd yet, in using GPS, I often find that I have less of a feel for the area in which I travel. GPS may provide a reliable series of instructions telling me when to turn left or right, but I frequently find that in using GPS, I lose a “big picture” context (i.e., where I am within a larger area, especially in relation to other cities, highways, and landmarks). In contrast, those paper maps of days gone by gave me a much better sense of where my travels fit within the overall landscape.\\n\\n\\nLosing Big Picture Context\\n\\n\\nI see my GPS experience as a reasonable metaphor that can apply to just about any organization. So often businesses are under tremendous pressure to make detailed decisions about very specific projects, programs, and objectives. In these cases, there is frequently a sense of urgency in figuring out how to get from Point A to Point B (e.g., from today’s current product to tomorrow’s new product) without getting lost or wasting a lot of time and money. The focus is often narrowly focused on an immediate destination (e.g., the next product) and determining the best path to get there as quickly and efficiently as possible. Such efforts are important and often critical to an organization’s success.\\n\\n\\nHowever, sometimes corporations plan these destinations while also having lost track of their own big picture context. These firms begin their journey only to discover that they are now operating in a different landscape. They learn that changing economic conditions, industry dynamics, customer preferences, and/or competitive initiatives have created roadblocks that limit their progress. Or they complete their journey only to find that others have a better understanding of the overall market “map” and have found a better, faster, more innovative route to success.\\n\\n\\nAuthor and strategist Annie Duke points to Sony and Apple as examples of this phenomena. Many years back, Sony reflected on the success that its Walkman tape and CD players had experienced and determined that they should continue on the path of enhancing these products rather than replace them. In contrast, Apple recognized that the market and technology landscape had changed and introduced the digital iPod as a result. Before long, Apple became the dominant player in the portable music market while Sony occupied a diminished market position.\\n\\n\\nNavigating Market Disruption Successfully\\n\\n\\nSo how can organizations be smart about developing their own “Corporate GPS?” How can these firms ensure that they see the forest for the trees and are able to navigate their markets successfully? And what can these organizations do when the landscape begins to look disrupted and unfamiliar?\\n\\n\\nThe key is to adopt well-rounded, ongoing efforts to monitor and research the trends and opportunities associated with the larger market context, while also investigating promising, close-in opportunities. \\xa0While that advice may sound reasonable in a general sense, you may wonder how that translates into specific, practical actions that you and your organization could take.\\n\\n\\nGaining a big picture concept means adopting a global perspective while also engaging in a comprehensive, in-depth approach to developing market insights. There are four keys to Corporate GPS success:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGlobal Perspective: \\nOpportunities often abound (as do threats) outside the lens that firms sometimes apply to themselves. By thinking more broadly about markets served and products offered, organizations will better understand how they can adapt and thrive in an ever-changing landscape.\\n\\n\\nPrimary Market Research: \\nWhen it comes to understanding the needs, motivations, and behaviors of customers, no one is better suited to provide these insights than customers themselves. Research that addresses a customized set of issues with a specific target audience provides the kind of in-depth insights necessary for both near-term and long-term decision making.\\n\\n\\nSecondary Market Research: \\nTapping into the vast array of information and data available in the public domain is another key to gaining a more comprehensive view of markets. As this information often comes from multiple sources and is broadly focused, secondary research is an excellent resource for gaining big picture perspective, such as market trends.\\n\\n\\nAdvisory Services: \\nBecause they are staffed with industry experts who are very familiar with their respective industries, competitors, and products, Advisory Services are an important piece of an organization’s market insights approach. As big picture experts, advisory service analysts use their deep industry knowledge to provide a comprehensive view of market landscapes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn summary, when it comes to establishing a successful Corporate GPS, firms need to develop a broad understanding of their overall landscape so that they can successfully navigate within it. By so doing, organizations will be able to leverage opportunities, mitigate challenges, and evolve and even transform over time.\\n\\n\\nWe’d love to discuss how we could work together to develop a successful Corporate GPS plan for your organization.'}\n","{'Index': 56, 'Heading': 'Nothing Can Slow the Automotive Industry’s Steady March Toward Electrification', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/nothing-can-slow-the-automotive-industrys-steady-march-toward-electrification/', 'Content': 'Not Even COVID-19 or a Global Semiconductor Shortage\\n\\n\\nIn March 2020, the world began to grapple with the notion that life would be majorly disrupted as the deadly and devastating COVID-19 pandemic set in. For the automotive industry, two threats loomed large: a years-long sales plateau finally giving way to a significant retraction—exacerbated by a pandemic-fueled demand crash—and the impact of that revenue loss on the development of future vehicles and tech, including electrification.\\n\\n\\nWhen we conducted this year’s \\nEVForward\\n Segmentation and built our \\nMarket Profile\\n report, we found consumers’ views of EVs do not reflect those fears:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFavorable sentiments regarding battery electric vehicles (BEVs), in particular, have grown.

In this case, however, car shoppers are sending strong signals to automakers with their wallets, too.\\n\\n\\nDespite facing a slump in the immediate wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, electric vehicle sales have rebounded to outpace pre-shutdown levels by a wide margin. In December 2020 and March 2021, sales for all EVs (hybrid, plug-in and battery) in the United States eclipsed the 100,000-unit mark for the first and second times, respectively.

Newer recruitment methodologies were thought to fully replace CATI by now, but Escalent’s \\xa0telephone research practice is thriving as one way to help our clients accomplish their goals using a quick, cost-effective—and admittedly unsexy—methodology.\\n\\n\\nAs one of a few research consultancies that has an in-house telephone research team, Escalent has seen first-hand how our 175 dedicated team members have helped solve our clients’ business needs, whether it’s simply because telephone recruitment is the best option for executing the study or because it provides an important complement to digital methods, like emailing and SMS.\\n\\n\\nHere are four examples:\\n\\n\\nManaging High-Impact, Executive-Facing Work\\n\\n\\nOne of our most rewarding and challenging projects involved reaching out to a client’s dissatisfied, angry customers—customers who weren’t shy about contacting the highest levels of our client’s organization to air their grievances. Email outreach was far too impersonal for follow-up like this so Escalent was engaged to call the customers to identify and resolve their issues and to open up a line of communication to help our client better understand and address their customers’ concerns.\\n\\n\\nUsing this more human approach, the telephone research team had a significant impact on customer satisfaction by shining a light on serious issues and helping to repair relationships. The work was an unmitigated success and valued widely across our client’s organization.\\n\\n\\nMaximizing Sample Size and Representation\\n\\n\\nOftentimes a client’s customer list is not large enough to achieve sample size goals via the web, like when we’re researching a B2B audience or a specific type of consumer. Other times, there simply aren’t enough email addresses in the client’s database.\\n\\n\\nIn these cases, we find that multi-mode recruitment, using telephone and email, allows us to achieve sample sizes that would be unattainable from email recruitment alone. Additionally, a multi-mode approach is more inclusive of all customers. This is important as customers who do not have an email address on record may differ from customers who do, in ways that impact insights. By providing another means of connecting with these customers, our clients get more representative and more accurate data.\\n\\n\\nIn terms of execution, our team strategically focuses on calling customers who do not have an email address first, while simultaneously sending email invitations to those customers with an email available. Later, we switch our focus to reach out via telephone to those who did not respond to our email invitations. This maximizes our response rates and achieves sample size goals in the most cost-efficient way possible.\\n\\n\\nExecuting on Legally Required Outreach\\n\\n\\nFor years, Escalent has helped utilities meet regulatory requirements to measure the impact gas pipelines have on local communities. This research requires outreach to several relevant audiences, including those who live near the pipeline, as well as local public officials and emergency first responders. Typically email addresses are hard to come by for these populations, making web research a challenge. For this type of work, we have consistently found that telephone outreach, coupled with other modes when possible, offers the best option to meet regulatory requirements.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, we have helped clients conduct outreach for automotive recalls that pose a safety threat to vehicle owners. In one recent study, we used telephone outreach to talk with vehicle owners who had not responded to the recall. We first asked if they were aware that there was a recall, and then we helped them schedule appointments to service their vehicle. We also answered any questions they had about the recall and transferred them directly to a customer service representative when desired. The customers we contacted were previously sent multiple letters and emails about the recall but never scheduled a recall appointment. By using telephone outreach and equipping our interviewers to help these customers schedule a service visit, our client serviced many more vehicles and protected their customers from potential safety issues.\\n\\n\\nCollecting Detailed Feedback on Complex Topics\\n\\n\\nRecently we helped a Financial Services client explore innovation among executive-level customers. To do this, our telephone interviewers built a rapport with these executives, maintaining a detailed history of interactions with them to ensure they all received the level of communication needed. Interviewers went through online training to familiarize themselves with the research topic so they could capture rich and detailed feedback, clarify questions, and probe for additional information.\\n\\n\\nOur clients were convinced that this type of customer would not spend the time and effort to take a nuanced survey like this on the web, but fortunately our telephone interviewers were able to steward the executives through the survey and made it easy for them to participate.\\n\\n\\nAnd That is Why…\\n\\n\\nTelephone outreach is certainly not an appropriate tool for every market research challenge, but it still brings value when applied to the right problems in the right way. So, before you chalk up this methodology as a relic of the Jurassic Era, consider that, in many ways, telephone research can still have one heck of a bite.\\n\\n\\nTo learn if telephone market research is right for your latest challenge, send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 58, 'Heading': 'Phase Five of Innovation: Manage an Innovative Product or Service in an Ever-Changing Market to Remain Relevant', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/manage-an-innovative-product-or-service-in-an-ever-changing-market-to-remain-relevant/', 'Content': 'The Final Phase of our Five-Part Guide to Successful Innovation\\n\\n\\nThis is the final installment of our five-part blog series about how businesses can innovate and adjust to market change using a five-phase framework for innovation.

We began by exploring how to identify areas of opportunities in the \\nSearch phase\\n and then delved into how to generate ideas for relevant solutions in the \\nDevelop phase\\n.

Gathering post-launch feedback—such as sales metrics, reviews and market share—can help identify what adjustments are needed to extend viability and profitability for as long as possible.\\n\\n\\nThis is where we answer questions such as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do we make sure our products or services stay relevant in the marketplace?\\n\\n\\nHow do we adjust or refine our strategy to remain competitive?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are some Manage phase issues our clients faced and how we helped them.\\n\\n\\nExample #1: Creating an Ongoing Customer Dialogue to Secure Brand and Product Feedback\\n\\n\\nA major automotive manufacturer conducted research on an ad hoc basis to understand what types of products, experiences and innovations its customers and prospects wanted. However, the company wanted a way to gather more timely and cost-effective feedback on product-related questions, so it turned to Escalent for a solution.\\n\\n\\nWe engaged 5,000 automobile owners in an online \\nInsight Community\\n that we designed to quickly gather member input on a variety of topics by participating in visually engaging activities. Gaining a deep understanding of the actual experiences customers had with the manufacturer’s own products as well as competitive products, our client was able to compare this with the expectations of new vehicle owners to identify how to refine its offerings for greater customer satisfaction. In return for their participation, we regularly updated members about the impact their feedback was having on the client’s products and services.\\n\\n\\nThis two-way engagement revealed iterative insights for the brand while giving it an effective way to nurture a trusting relationship with the members. Our client continues to use this community as an efficient tool to collaborate with customers and as an iterative, two-way engagement platform that delivers valuable strategic insight.\\n\\n\\nExample #2: Optimizing the Promotion of a Late-Stage Pharmaceutical Brand\\n\\n\\nA pharmaceutical company was budget-constrained and had a product that was the only branded offering in its class. Given these constraints, the company turned to Escalent to identify which physicians it could target to optimize its market share against generic brands before losing its patent exclusivity.\\n\\n\\nConducting a study with US-based physicians, we combined the survey data with the client’s prescription data and insurance/access data. Using various algorithms to link these datasets, we identified three strategic segments in the client’s database of 40,000 physicians with extremely high accuracy. The company developed its go-forward strategy based on this solution and prioritized its marketing resources to promote this late-stage product to the right physicians. Two years later, we are pleased to report our client successfully optimized the promotion and market share of its branded product.\\n\\n\\nWe hope this blog series on successful innovation was helpful and provided the tools you need to understand what phase your products and services are in and how you can move forward with confidence in delighting customers.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about how Escalent can help you innovate, send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 59, 'Heading': 'Phase Four of Innovation: Establish a Successful Go-to-Market Strategy for New Products and Services', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/establish-a-successful-go-to-market-strategy-for-new-products-and-services/', 'Content': 'Part Four of Our Five-Part Guide to Successful Innovation\\n\\n\\nThis is the fourth post of a five-part blog series about how businesses can innovate and adjust to market change using a five-phase framework for innovation.

The question is, \\nhow do you launch and market your new product or service to give it the best shot at success?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhase Four of Innovation: Launch—Preparing for Market Entry\\n\\n\\nThe Launch phase is where the rubber meets the road. There is a lot on the line, and it is important you have put all of your resources in the right places for the best shot at success. If you build it, will they come? While Ray Kinsella from \\nField of Dreams\\n had the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson to bring in the fans, you might need multiple promotional strategies—there’s much more to a launch than simply making a product, service or experience available for purchase.\\n\\n\\nIn preparation for going to market, you will need to determine how a new offering should be positioned and supported as well as where and how it should be offered. A successful launch involves crafting the right messaging, placement and pricing. This means fine-tuning the touchpoints between your business and your customers and prospects.\\n\\n\\nHere are some Launch phase challenges our clients faced and how we helped them improve their go-to-market strategy.\\n\\n\\nExample #1: Launching a Major League Rugby Team in a Previously Untested US City\\n\\n\\nMajor League Rugby\\n (MLR) is the top tier of competitive, professional rugby in the US, and Atlanta was invited to include a team in the 2020 league expansion. This was exciting, but the new team’s owners had many questions, such as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs there sufficient interest for an Atlanta-based rugby team to draw crowds?\\n\\n\\nWhere should the team play to give fans easy access?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe team owners brought Escalent on board to conduct a detailed market analysis and provide recommendations to optimize the launch of the new team.\\n\\n\\nFirst, we needed to determine the demand for rugby in the region. To do this, we conducted an Atlanta market study to assess the viability of a new MLR team. Constructing the survey with inspiration from previous brand and \\nsponsorship research\\n we have conducted for clients, we evaluated the awareness of and enthusiasm for rugby as a sport. Then, we dove deeper into specific topics such as team name, team colors and stadium location. Most importantly, we collected data that quantitatively predicted the number of avid fans as well as likely television viewership and attendance figures. The owners used the findings as the cornerstone of their launch planning and, in February 2020, Rugby ATL was born. The team played its \\nfirst game ever against the Utah Warriors\\n at the Life University stadium in North Atlanta and won in a packed arena.\\n\\n\\nExample #2: Launching a New Brand in an Emerging Market\\n\\n\\nA cannabidiol (CBD) company was developing a new pharmaceutical-grade product to assist athletes in relieving joint and muscle fatigue and pain. The company turned to Escalent to better understand how consumers perceived its brand, identify areas of opportunity, pinpoint the most effective way to message the product and, at the same time, evaluate initial market feedback on the new product while it was in development.\\n\\n\\nTo create an effective go-to-market strategy and positively position this new CBD brand across current and potential customers, we conducted a quantitative survey to identify where opportunity existed in the marketplace. Interestingly, we discovered targeting athletes was alienating the general market, which was interested in the product but turned off by the athletic focus. We delivered a highly visual report laying out key points for messaging development and future brand extensions. The company used the critical insights we provided to refine its branding and marketing communication for better, more on-target results.\\n\\n\\nSimply putting a new product or service out into the market does not ensure success. New offerings must be positioned properly to ensure customers and consumers clearly see the value and benefit of what you are providing. While it may feel daunting to consider the resources and investment required to properly test and refine a product launch, a partner like Escalent can help you cut through the noise to create an effective go-to-market strategy.\\n\\n\\nNext:\\n Now that you have launched your new product or service, you will need to keep up with new market dynamics that come your way.

Of course, not all ideas are good ones, so some may need to be tossed out.\\n\\n\\nIf you are asking these types of questions, you are in the Validate phase of the innovation journey:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes the new product or service we designed achieve the goals and deliver the value we are seeking to provide our customers?\\n\\n\\nHow does the new product or service we developed resonate with consumers?\\n\\n\\nHow do we test the new product or service to make sure it hits the mark with consumers?\\n\\n\\nWhat are the best ways to refine or adjust our new product or service for maximum success?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are some Validate phase issues our clients faced and how we helped them gather the data and insights necessary to confidently confirm which products and services have the best shot at success.\\n\\n\\nExample #1: Testing a New Human Machine Interface to Ensure a Delightful Customer Experience\\n\\n\\nAn original equipment manufacturer sought to create an extensive new user interface system in its vehicles that would be intuitive, visually appealing, functional and easy to use. The manufacturer developed a new design that encompassed menus and information in the instrument panel and center displays, along with controls on the steering wheel and center console. The manufacturer then asked us to evaluate and determine if the newly designed human machine interface (HMI) achieved its goals.\\n\\n\\nTo do so, our highly experienced user experience researchers put the new HMI system to the test with consumers in a static environment to better understand how intuitive and functional the system was. We recommended multiple design updates based on the consumer insights we gathered, which our client integrated into the development process of the new interface. As our client fine-tuned the design, we tested it multiple times and worked closely together on refining details to ensure a great experience for customers. Once satisfied with the new system, the manufacturer rolled the HMI into production and continued to survey customers when the product was on the market to ensure its new HMI was hitting the mark. The result? An overwhelmingly positive response, with buyer surveys confirming an “excellent” owner experience.\\n\\n\\nExample #2: Establishing the Value and Priority of New Concepts with One Easy Excitement Score™\\n\\n\\nSeeking to distinguish itself from the competition, a major smartphone manufacturer identified a whopping 22 innovative features it could build into its next generation of phones. The company turned to Escalent for help in evaluating and prioritizing these features for further development.\\n\\n\\nTo avoid the “analysis paralysis” that comes with comparing multiple metrics across 22 concepts, we applied Escalent’s proprietary Excitement Score™ methodology, which is extremely efficient at identifying the feature or features that generate the most enthusiasm from consumers and have the most promise in the market. Excitement Score uses key driver analysis to combine various metrics into a single value for each concept. This allowed us to reduce the potential 154 data points to 22 Excitement Scores. As a result, our client had a clear understanding of the value of each feature and knew—at a glance—which concepts were worth developing.\\n\\n\\nAs a bonus, our client now has its own database of concepts against which it can benchmark future concepts.\\n\\n\\nIf you have some great ideas to help your business grow but want to test them before you go to market, you are in the right place. Escalent has multiple tools and services to help any business put its ideas to the test. We will hone in on your best ideas so you can feel confident in your investment.\\n\\n\\nNext:\\n We show you what you need to think about and do before you push a new product or service into the market in the \\nLaunch phase\\n. Now that you know what you want to do, it will be critical to put the right promotions and resources in place to position your product or service for success.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about how Escalent can help you innovate, send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 61, 'Heading': 'Phase Two of Innovation: Engage Creatives to Generate Ideas and Develop Relevant Concepts for New Products and Services', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/engage-creatives-to-generate-ideas-and-develop-relevant-concepts-for-new-products-and-services/', 'Content': 'Part Two of Our Five-Part Guide to Successful Innovation\\n\\n\\nThis is the second post of a five-part blog series about how businesses can innovate and adjust to market change using a five-phase framework for innovation. We break down one phase per blog, laying out the business challenges that typically align with each phase and the various ways to address them. In \\nthe first blog\\n, we explored how to identify underlying consumer pain points and areas of opportunities for a brand to explore in the Search phase. \\n\\n\\nNow that you have uncovered meaningful areas of opportunities to grow your business in the Search phase, it’s time to move into the Develop phase to generate ideas, develop concepts and construct relevant solutions that your company can provide to move consumers toward their ideal, desired state of being.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhase Two of Innovation: Develop—Creating Solutions\\n\\n\\nIn this phase, you will dig into answering the following types of questions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat\\n can we do to address the identified gaps and opportunities in meaningful and unique ways for consumers?\\n\\n\\nHow\\n might we do this? What would that look like?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou might feel stumped about how to come up with creative ideas for solutions that go beyond simple, incremental changes to existing products and services—especially if your R&D team feels depleted. This is where Creatives come into play.\\n\\n\\nWorking with Creatives to Spur Innovative Thinking\\n\\n\\nInvolving the \\nright\\n\\xa0types of people\\n—such as Creatives—at the\\xa0\\nright\\n\\xa0points along the innovation journey makes all the difference during this phase of the process.\\n\\n\\nCreatives are people who can generate lots of highly unique ideas for new innovative products and services. Regardless of whether they have creative abilities in “traditional” areas such as art, design or music, Creatives generally have a wide breadth of interests and can transfer their highly unique abilities across categories and industries.\\n\\n\\nHere are some Develop phase issues our clients faced, what we did to help them and how we involved Creatives.\\n\\n\\nExample #1: Creating Innovative Solutions with Facilities Managers\\n\\n\\nOne of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of paper products and dispensers wanted to answer the needs of high-volume facilities managers—particularly those who oversee sports arenas, entertainment venues and office buildings. One way of doing this was for the company to update the way in which toilet paper was dispensed, so it challenged us to generate unique ideas for its product development pipeline.\\n\\n\\nWe began by identifying facilities directors and maintenance coordinators who exhibited high levels of creativity and invited them to a multiday, virtual idea-generation session. Each day, we tackled a different problem associated with high-volume bathrooms—such as paper waste, flooding and vandalism—and came up with new ways to address each one. Armed with more than 500 starter ideas, we organized them into themes, such as “short-term storage,” that served as core development platforms from which we more fully developed two to three concepts for each resulting theme. We shared these solution concepts with a small group of facilities managers and incorporated their feedback into our final refinement of the concepts for the client.\\n\\n\\nExample #2: Working with Creatives to Reimagine the Purchase Experience\\n\\n\\nA North American manufacturer and marketer of commercial and residential kitchen and bathroom fixtures realized it needed to address consumer pain points inherent in the purchase process to increase sales. The company’s biggest challenge was the inability for consumers to experience its products prior to buying and installing them. As its long-time innovation partner, the company turned to us for unique ideas and solutions to this problem.\\n\\n\\nWe used a proprietary screening method to recruit Creatives from across the US and then sent them on in-person and virtual shopping assignments designed to lend fresh perspective around the purchase process. After, we conducted a two-day, virtual co-creation session involving the Creatives and members of our client team. We generated nearly 100 ideas for new ways in which consumers could experience how the company’s products felt and worked prior to making a purchase. Our client selected 10 ideas it felt held the most promise, which we then developed into more defined concepts for our client to use in internal discussions and as platforms from which to design purchase experiences.\\n\\n\\nWe provided both clients with a fresh outlook by identifying and including imaginative consumers who bring new perspectives, options and ideas.\\n\\n\\nIf you are looking for ways to generate new and creative solutions that will meet the needs of consumers, you may consider engaging a partner to help you determine the best way to do so and when to involve consumers. Escalent takes into account your specific challenge, industry and company objectives to help you identify the right types of consumers to involve in the creative process at the right time. We will help you fill your pipeline with innovative products and services that will move the needle for consumers and your business growth.\\n\\n\\nNext:\\n We explore how to test, confirm and refine relevant solutions in the Validate phase.

One of her key conclusions was that “it is imperative that companies understand the factors that influence how people come to trust autonomous vehicle technology.” As I was reflecting on this premise and other related conversations, I started to think about similar situations in our lives where trust is a key factor to accepting change and adopting new behaviors. While we are grappling with the risks and implications of trusting a new technology that holds the promise of autonomously driving humans without their intervention, the process of letting go and giving up control—a core tenet of trust—is a familiar human experience. Of course, the bar is extremely high for self-driving vehicles because, at its highest level of autonomy (\\nLevel 5\\n), “letting go and giving up control” to the technology can have life and death implications, something we typically only afford to humans. Understanding how we build the highest level of trust among humans may, therefore, be the key to understanding how we can build trust between humans and self-driving vehicles.\\n\\n\\n“Mom, Dad, May I Have the Car Keys?”\\n\\n\\nAny parent of teenage children can remember the day when their child asked them for the car keys to drive by themselves for the first time. Saying “yes” was scary and nerve-wracking and probably elicited a slew of silent prayers as parents watched their child drive off alone, hoping and trusting that years of teaching, training and experience had helped their child develop enough muscle memory and good decision-making to drive safely and responsibly on their own. Of course, the first drive was not going to be a spring break road trip but a short trip to a friend’s house three blocks over in broad daylight. Next came driving at night, then when it rained and, eventually, through a severe storm.\\n\\n\\nThis was also most likely not the first time when a parent was faced with a choice to trust—or not—in the abilities of their child. Think about a child or a young family member who learned how to swim. Similar situation: after dozens of hours of lessons and practice came the day when a parent had to make a careful determination about the readiness of the child to swim on his or her own. Most likely, this decision was made while the parent kept a watchful eye over the child, only allowing them to swim within a safe distance away.\\n\\n\\nJust thinking about these two examples illustrates how humans develop trust among each other in situations that involve life and death decisions: it’s a process that happens over time and involves many little steps taken one at a time. And while a child’s ability to learn how to swim or ride a bike or drive a car may be good indicators of his or her abilities to responsibly act in risky, challenging situations that could result in harm or worse, each new situation is approached with its own criteria and requirements to build trust.\\n\\n\\nIn this sense, the process of learning how to trust self-driving vehicles may be similar to the human experience of learning how to trust that a child can swim or drive on his or her own. At some point, engineers and consumers will have to trust that the technology has developed enough “muscle memory” to make good decisions and safely chauffer passengers to their destinations. This means fully self-driving vehicles will have to be able to react correctly not only in predictable situations but also in unforeseen circumstances, assess evolving dangers correctly (such as when the road is getting too slippery and the vehicle needs to slow down) and pull over when necessary (such as when sirens are blaring from an oncoming police car, ambulance or fire truck). In other words, reactive behavior will be just as important as proactive behavior.\\n\\n\\nThe Complexity of Building Human Trust in Self-Driving Vehicles\\n\\n\\nSo, where are we in terms of trust when it comes to self-driving vehicles?\\n\\n\\nOur recent findings show we still have a long way to go. Earlier this year when we asked consumers about their level of trust in self-driving vehicles that require no human intervention, consumers rated their trust a 5.1 on a scale of zero to 10 where 10 meant they completely trust the technology.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile this score may have indicated some cautious trust in the capabilities of self-driving vehicles, another question about the actual willingness to use such vehicles reveals a much greater level of hesitancy. When asked about their openness to using self-driving vehicles, we found that fewer than one-fifth of consumers said they were completely open to using self-driving vehicles. And this has consistently been the case for over two years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn other words, while there is some consumer openness to and, in some cases, even excitement about the technology, self-driving vehicles will still have to demonstrate a level of proficiency much closer to the human driver before consumers will put their trust in the “seats” of an AV. Or, as it was put so eloquently in a 2004 white paper on \\nTrust in automation: Designing for appropriate reliance\\n by Lee & See: “Trust stands between the beliefs about the characteristics of the automation and the intention to rely on the automation.”\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to navigating a vehicle, replicating the human experience and intuition isn’t easy and with every new advancement, AV makers discover new challenges and obstacles. Developing muscle memory is one of the hardest and most time-consuming things to do, as every athlete knows. Thomas Muller, CTO engineering and global practice, NextGen Services at Wipro, addressed this challenge and underscored the importance for AV makers to include human driver behavior data in their quest to build fully self-driving autonomous vehicle technology in a \\nrecent article\\n:\\n\\n\\nMueller said the value of human driver behavior will always outweigh that of the robot. He added: “This delta data of comparing a human driver who is actually driving day-to-day and comparing it to what the synthetic driver, which is getting smarter by the day, is the most valuable data there is. With a test driver sitting in an autonomous vehicle and doing nothing, the computer cannot compare how a human can handle a situation. So it will always behave like a robot and not like a human.”\\n\\n\\nConversely, we may also find that some human behavior will have to change or adapt to embrace a new self-driving vehicle reality, such as learning new “traffic rules” or interpreting new information that was not available or necessary when we were in control of the vehicle.\\n\\n\\nThe Kiddie Pool and the Parking Lot\\n\\n\\nFor now in AV development, we are at the “kiddie pool” or in a “parking lot” watching our youngsters take their first strokes or drives. In order for us to trust them on their own one day, they will have to demonstrate they are able to stand on their own feet at every step of the way. For AVs, this will mean the technology will have to demonstrate it has a solid grasp of its environment, it can handle typical driving situations with increasing difficulty and it can make the right decisions when it comes into dangerous or ambiguous situations. Additionally, AV makers will need to confirm the quality and design are up to everyday challenges and that the public infrastructure and environment upon which AVs rely (such as traffic lights and other autonomous, connected vehicles) are safe and reliable—which is a whole different topic and challenge unto itself. Before most consumers will set foot into a self-driving vehicle, they will most likely want to see independent proof that the vehicle has passed all safety tests.\\n\\n\\nFor example, this could include future test drives to be done remotely by watching a self-driving vehicle in real-time through a camera. For some people, it may take a long time before they fully trust a self-driving vehicle, preferring to stay “in the shallow end of the pool” for awhile—for instance, only occasionally taking a ride in an autonomous bus or taxi. Only if the self-driving vehicle has earned enough trust with the passenger in simple situations will the person in question be willing to let it “swim further out.” On the other hand, allowing passengers to have some level of control, such as deciding which roads to take, may be an easy way to build consumer trust and ease concerns without altering the overall experience.\\n\\n\\nLifeguard On Duty\\n\\n\\nWhile I am sure we, as a society, will learn to trust self-driving vehicles one day, we may also decide to always have a “lifeguard” on duty. As much as we know that we have to let a child swim on his or her own one day, we always feel a little better if there is a lifeguard around because we know that humans are not perfect and accidents can happen. And in our modern-day life, we know the same is true for technology. While autonomous vehicles can help to dramatically reduce the number of vehicle deaths caused by human error, we have yet to allow technology to become the sole operator in life-or-death situations. For every rocket, there is a mission control. For every auto pilot, there is a human pilot. For every intensive care machine, there is an intensive care nurse.\\n\\n\\nThis creates an opportunity for new revenue streams for manufacturers and service providers, the first examples of which have started to pop up, including an announcement by Visteon in 2020 to \\n“add remote-control capabilities to its autonomous-driving platform.”\\n Having an AV “lifeguard” will likely also help speed up adoption: consumers may come to trust AVs earlier or more widely than they otherwise would have if they know there is a trusted source of help available as a backup should the AV technology encounter an error.\\n\\n\\nAs a company whose mission it is to help brands translate human behavior into ideas that make the world work better for people, Escalent is excited about the prospect of fully self-driving vehicles. We look forward to working with our clients on understanding the factors that influence how humans come to trust one another and to translating those learnings into effective strategies for building trust between humans and self-driving vehicles.\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to learn how we can help you build self-driving vehicles that are trusted by consumers or want to know more about our capabilities, please send us a note.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMethods Disclosure \\n\\n\\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of approximately 1,000 consumers aged 18 and older over a two week period each month from Q1 2019 to Q1 2021.\\xa0Respondents were recruited from the Dynata\\xa0opt-in online panel of US adults and were interviewed online.\\xa0Quotas were put in place to achieve a sample of age, gender, income and ethnicity that matches the demographics of the US population.\\xa0The data have a margin of error of 3 percentage points at a confidence level of 95%.

We break down one phase per blog, laying out the business challenges that typically align with each phase and the various ways to address them.\\n\\n\\nWhat Is Innovation?\\n\\n\\nThere is no one answer to this question. For some, innovation calls to mind companies that create new, avant-garde products or services that address a need more quickly, efficiently and conveniently. Others might think of innovation as entailing radical changes in business models or perhaps entering new categories entirely.\\n\\n\\nIn this past year, there certainly has been no shortage of stories about businesses of all sizes demonstrating agility and speed as they strive to survive and remain relevant in a world challenged by a once-in-a-century pandemic. This includes retailers pivoting their business to serve the changing needs of their communities, tech services such as Zoom stepping up to meet a rapid influx in demand, and automotive manufacturers producing personal protective equipment. While examples such as these illustrate one type of easy-to-understand innovation, there are lots of other ways businesses and professionals can innovate.\\n\\n\\nInnovation as a Journey\\n\\n\\nEscalent approaches innovation as a journey that places empathy—whether for consumers, a company’s customers or ends users—at the center of everything a business does. There are many ways to frame this journey; we’ve chosen a five-phase framework for its simplicity and its applicability to product, service, experience, communication and business model innovation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEach phase is unique, distinguished by the types of business challenges it addresses.\\n\\n\\nIn this post, we delve into the Search phase, which focuses on opportunity discovery. If you are asking questions such as the following, you’re in the right place:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAre there needs or gaps in the marketplace that my company can fill?\\n\\n\\nAre there new markets for my company to address?\\n\\n\\nWhich consumers should my company pursue?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhase One of Innovation: Search—Identifying Opportunities\\n\\n\\nThe first phase of the innovation framework—Search—is where opportunity discovery takes place. The objective of the Search phase is to understand consumers’ needs, what consumers want in an ideal world and, as such, where your business can fill the gaps that exist in the market. Additionally, the Search phase is designed to generate a functional understanding of these needs and desires, providing guardrails to ensure a company grounds any innovation initiatives in empathy and how its products and services can empower consumers to reach their objectives and goals. \\nThis is what allows a business or brand to achieve market success at the end of its innovation journey.\\n\\n\\nHere are two examples of Search phase challenges our clients faced and how we helped them innovate.\\n\\n\\nExample #1: Identifying the Future Needs of Consumers and New Strategies to Fill the Gaps\\n\\n\\nOur client had a strong reputation for providing some of the best-in-category services in the household care and management space. To protect and increase its leadership position, our client wanted to understand how it should refine its offerings and business practices to continually meet consumers’ fast-changing needs and expectations for managing their home.\\n\\n\\nAs practitioners of \\nClayton Christensen’s Theory of Jobs to Be Done\\n, we believe “jobs” represent individuals’ desire to move from their existing situation to an ideal state, and provide fresh perspective into how businesses should focus their innovation resources.\\n\\n\\nWe conducted a series of Jobs-to-Be-Done interviews to explore how consumers feel about managing their household today and how they ultimately want to feel. We laddered those feelings up to a set of fundamental humanistic needs, including pride, belonging and security. From this, we defined a number of areas of opportunity, or jobs, such as “help me create a happy home life for myself and others.” These jobs served as a North Star for our client in developing new offerings, messaging and business processes designed to move consumers closer to their ideal state of home management.\\n\\n\\nExample #2: Using a Different Segmentation Strategy to Grow Business\\n\\n\\nA quick-service restaurant had an interesting challenge that focused on understanding what motivated its frequent customers. At face value, it was difficult to understand why these customers visited multiple times a week but at different times of the day. The company asked us to design a segmentation strategy that would identify areas of growth to better serve these customers.\\n\\n\\nHaving conducted a wide variety of segmentations for businesses in various industries, we knew the typical segmentation approach—aligning one customer with only one segment—would not give our client meaningful insight into its high-frequency-multiple-occasion purchase model. Instead, we created a segmentation based on what was purchased and why the purchase occurred rather than on the profiles of individual customers. This allowed us to understand the various motivations behind consumers’ in-the-moment purchase behaviors. By combining needs, types of food and drinks, and other purchase drivers, we defined segments that represented occasions for interaction with our client’s products, brand or industry category.\\xa0This permitted a single consumer to fall into more than one “occasion segment.”\\n\\n\\nOur \\noccasion-based segmentation\\n strategy helps a company understand the distinct occasions in which consumers purchase and interact with products or categories. Since it’s done on the category level, and not just for the brand, a company can find out where it’s performing well and discover new opportunities for growing its brand or market share. As a result, our client is leveraging this new occasion-based segmentation strategy to revise its product creation, communication and marketing strategies to better serve the needs of these occasion segments and spur brand growth.\\n\\n\\nIf you are looking for new growth areas for your business, you may want to engage with a partner to help you identify the right moves for your company. Escalent takes into account your specific challenge, industry and outlook to help you identify specific areas of growth. We will help you chart a course of action to make the most of your business strategy and lead the way for others.\\n\\n\\nNext:\\n We explore how to create relevant solutions in the \\nDevelop phase\\n.

That’s not the case today. More data, differing views and use cases, and an appreciation for a customized approach based on your industry have led market research and marketing professionals to embrace a variety of approaches.\\n\\n\\nIn a \\nprevious blog\\n, I highlighted how occasion-based segmentation can be a more actionable and valuable solution for higher-frequency categories where consumer needs vary. Now, I’d like to focus on another type of segmentation that we at Escalent affectionately call augmented segmentation.\\n\\n\\nAugmented segmentation embraces the world we live in today where there are multiple data streams and a need for segmentation solutions that build or expand on an existing solution.\\n\\n\\nOften when I speak with my clients, they have an existing segmentation solution they’ve developed from their own behavioral or transactional data. These data are powerful. The solution doesn’t rely on self-reported behavior from consumers, so analytics teams say it’s the “real thing” because it’s objective. However, clients regularly come to me saying that while their solution is based on tons of data points and there are some clear consumer segments that arise, the segmentation solution lacks the deeper consumer understanding from the multidimensional standpoint that clients need. While the solution tells my clients what the segments are doing, it doesn’t tell clients why the different segments behave the way they do, what they need or how they behave outside of the client brand. In sum, clients don’t understand the core of the segment—what consumers value and how they approach the category.\\n\\n\\nAnother area where clients’ solution sometimes falls short is that it doesn’t provide meaningful differentiation between segments. Sometimes, the segments blur together and it isn’t clear why the segments are different or what is driving the differences between them. I often hear that these behavioral-data-only solutions feel a little gray when our clients want full color.\\n\\n\\nThat’s where augmented segmentation comes into play. The goal of this approach is to elevate an existing segmentation solution by layering in attitudinal and additional behavioral data to create a multidimensional solution and view of consumers.\\n\\n\\nClosely Collaborating with Our Clients to Uplevel Their Segmentation\\n\\n\\nJust how far we take the augmented segmentation depends on client needs. Often, organizations have embraced the segmentation so it’s critical to keep the core of the solution as is but further flesh out the segments with more details that provide a deeper understanding of what is motivating consumers and why. Other times, clients are more open to deviating from the current solution when we show them that the data demand it. Either way, when we design an augmented segmentation solution, we focus on finding a balance between an enhanced version of the existing segments without straying too far from clients’ original segmentation.\\n\\n\\nTo do this, we collaborate closely with our clients to understand three main components:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe history of the current solution.\\n Where the current solution came from, how it has been used, what it does well and where it falls short.\\n\\n\\nThe in-depth details of what the solution does and does not provide.\\n What we know and don’t know about each consumer segment including the profile for each segment.\\n\\n\\nThe client’s desired future use of the solution.\\n Who will use it (product development, branding, marketing and communication?), how it will be used and what the goals are.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter we have established this baseline understanding, we move on to conducting primary quantitative research with consumers to create attitudinal and survey-based behavioral data to link with the clients’ existing behavioral data. These two data sources become the inputs for our new solution.\\n\\n\\nThe augmented segmentation analysis is a highly iterative process, one that explores many different solutions and approaches. It’s a mix of art and science and, through our various iterations and collaboration sessions with our clients, we craft and select a final solution.\\n\\n\\nThe result is an enhanced solution that provides a full view of the consumer segments clients craved. The combination of the behavioral, transaction and attitudinal data results in a more robust, meaningful and actionable solution. Full profiles and personas come to life. Clients can now truly embrace and understand each segment. The solutions are more inspiring for product development and marcom teams: they know enough about the segments to design products that will delight consumers and create communication platforms to reach them effectively. Suddenly, it all comes together and the segments become second nature insights. What was once a limited solution now shines.\\n\\n\\nElevating a Quick-Serve Restaurant’s Segmentation to Be More Actionable\\n\\n\\nThis was the case with a quick-serve restaurant (QSR) we worked with that had created a segmentation using the transactional data it had accumulated from its customers. Although the segmentation identified five customer segments differentiated on behavior, the client did not have insight into its customers’ priorities, needs, motivations and attitudes behind their decisions. Furthermore, the solution only focused on current customers, which did not support the company’s strategic priority to grow its business with new consumers.\\n\\n\\nTo provide the deeper details necessary to elevate our client’s segmentation with an augmented approach, we conducted a large-scale online survey with current and prospective customers to understand their category behaviors, attitudes, motivations and needs. Leveraging \\nEscalent’s advanced analytics team\\n, we linked our survey data with the QSR’s transactional data and designed a new model to transition the existing customer segments into enhanced segments that provided in-depth findings around purchase behaviors, attitudes, needs and demographics for both current and prospective customers. Our augmented segmentation delivered the insights our client needed to create a plan for future growth and more effectively inform brand, marketing and product development strategies.\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to know how to augment your existing segmentation solution, send us a note.

Now that we all work remotely, we chat regularly over the phone, through our Teams system, FaceTime, Zoom or WebEx. We flex our work day and find ways to connect meaningfully. Many of us have leaned into this new world in big and little ways. For example, I moved out of my suburban townhouse and into a more rural home with a bit of land and a beautiful view.

That old world where the sales team was flying hither and yon and taking clients to dinner to cement relationships or celebrate partnerships is over. The long-term impact of this change alone cascades out over many industries.\\n\\n\\nAirlines, hotels and restaurants will need to recalibrate expectations and revenue models for a long-term \\nreduction in business travel\\n. Additionally, service tiers, loyalty plans, marketing messages and the marketing mix will all need to be reimagined. There may be new areas of growth simmering, but one thing is sure, these businesses will need to quickly understand where they need to fill gaps and find new opportunities to make up for lost revenue.\\n\\n\\nOn the flip side, demand for high-end video-conferencing systems will rise, along with increased need for fast and seamless gigabit internet service flowing through newly upgraded home routers and modems for uninterrupted conferencing. And, as employees continue to migrate away from big cities, there will be fresh demand for better service in some of the harder-to-reach corners of the country. How to meet demand and evaluate where enhancements are needed to maintain healthy growth will be essential.\\n\\n\\nSome areas of growth may be surprising\\n\\n\\nDigital enhancements at home are being countered by very analog realities: building a physical home office with all the trappings. My friends who have moved to homes that accommodate work-from-home and home school setups are not alone. The many following this trend are kitting out their new homes with adjustable standing desks, ergonomic chairs, dual-monitor stations and printers. As I type out *printers* I can hear the collective groan of millions of Millennials and Xennials who had \\nfamously eschewed\\n\\xa0these analog devices but \\nnow find they require\\n them. The new work-from-home realities give printer companies new opportunities to lock in far more of these generational markets. Frankly, \\ntechnology\\n companies that have grown comfortable selling to businesses with IT staff face interesting opportunities will need to shift messaging, packaging and installation instructions to serve end users.\\n\\n\\nWorking from home represents a significant shift in how our world works across many elements. For example, it will impact public transportation and how we use automobiles—will people still need two cars per home? And, how does it change the calculation when considering electric cars?\\n\\n\\nThese changes aren’t temporary and the ripple effects have far-reaching impact. Over this past year, we witnessed a lot of adaptation with little understanding of what the long-term impact would be. Now, we are starting to see what the long-term changes are and how they might shape the future of how business is conducted across all levels.\\n\\n\\nLooking for a partner who can help make murky waters clear in your innovation journey?

A cross-cultural framework, especially when applied early to your strategy and development, can help you connect with global customers on their terms. In this article, I’ll show how to leverage a framework known as the 6-D Model to create localized experiences for your customers. By way of example, I look at why Japanese websites differ in design and user experience from the same sites created for Western users.\\n\\n\\nUsing Cross-Cultural Research in UX Research & Messaging\\n\\n\\nCultures are different. It makes sense that user preferences differ too. Localizing the customer experience requires a nuanced understanding of how people interpret your message, how they process information, and the types of experiences they value. Cross-cultural research is key to creative and experiential localization. It is not language-based and doesn’t simply strive for accurate and culturally attuned translations. Rather, cross-cultural research looks at how values, beliefs, and behaviors underpin what kinds of messages and user experiences drive desired actions.\\n\\n\\nOne framework that’s used by researchers, including those specializing in user experience research, customer experience research, and ethnography, is Geert Hofstede’s theory of cultural dimensions, also known as the 6-D Model. There’s a lot to this theory that we don’t need to unpack here, but here’s a quick overview.\\n\\n\\nHofstede was a social psychologist who looked at the effects of culture—both the culture of nations and the culture of organizations—on the preferences of its members. He and his research team developed a sociological survey to measure the preference of one state of being over another and used the data to distinguish national preferences on a 0 to 100 scale. He drew up indices reflecting national cultural characteristics of a country, which he called ‘cultural dimensions’.\\n\\n\\nCross-Cultural Research & The 6-D Model\\n\\n\\nThere were originally four and now six cultural dimensions, hence the 6-D Model. Each dimension indicates the degree to which a country:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs more or less hierarchical\\n\\n\\nPrioritizes the individual or the collective\\n\\n\\nPrioritizes ‘masculine’ values or ‘feminine’ values (We are not fans of the gender stereotypes associated with this metric)\\n\\n\\nIs more or less risk-averse\\n\\n\\nPreserves tradition or seeks change\\n\\n\\nRestrains gratification or indulges it\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s more on how these dimensions are defined and measured:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy way of illustration, take a look at Denmark and Sweden.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: \\nhofstede-insights.com\\n\\n\\nThese countries rate similarly across the 6-D board. Now, ask a Swede or a Dane, and each would invariably provide you with a host of differences between their respective countries. And they’d be justified in doing so. The 6-D Model is not a substitute for deep dives into nuanced cultural distinctions. But what cultural dimensions scores can tell you is that relative to each other, these countries are close in most of their preferences for one state of being over another.\\n\\n\\nYou could note that Swedes, generally, maybe more risk-averse than Danes. Though compared to Germany, which scores 83 on Long Term Orientation, Sweden would look like a land of risk-takers. The important thing to remember about the 6-D model and country comparisons is that they are just that, comparisons. Scores are relative differentiators, not judgments.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, take a look at Japan and the United States. There are some dramatic differences between how these two countries compare on the six cultural dimensions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding how these differences manifest in terms of needs, what types of messages resonate, and how people want to receive information about your brand is the essential work of user experience research, customer experience research, messaging research, and global consumer insights in general.\\n\\n\\nCombining Cross-Cultural Research with Customer & User Research to Create Localized Experiences\\n\\n\\nCulturally attuned UX research provides a useful baseline understanding of customer preferences, especially in the Discovery phase of research and development. The 6-D Model can be a useful lens for understanding how and why customer experience and design preferences are different across cultures. Whether it is a user interface, an in-store experience, or a visual design, our cultural biases inform how we process information and interact with it.\\n\\n\\nKnowing early on what those cultural predispositions are and how to leverage them is a key factor in the early stages of product development, customer experience, interaction design, product marketing, global campaign strategy, etc.\\n\\n\\nWhich brings us (naturally?) to Japanese websites. To the Western brain, Japanese websites are confusing (and this isn’t just because Google Translate has trouble with Kanji). Japanese sites typically condense a maximum amount of information on one page. Images are deprioritized in favor of the text. Take a look at the same day’s edition of the Japanese news site Yomiuri compared to its English language version, The Japan News.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: \\nyomiuri.co.jp\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n the-japan-news.com\\n\\n\\nYomiuri owns The Japan News, and both sites carry the same content, but one caters to locals and the other to Westerners. The layout of The Japan News is familiar to the Westerners, with the feature story above the fold, alongside a prominent visual. In contrast, Yomiuri presents more information within the same amount of space, utilizing a 3-column layout, with smaller images of equal proportion. Somewhat like Japan itself, where space is at a premium, and none is wasted, Japanese sites tend to pack a lot into a homepage, with multiple columns, lengthy text, and tiny images. For example, Yomiuri has a left-hand column with 32 content options, whereas The Japan News includes only a handful of these contained within subpages.\\n\\n\\nThis tendency to pack a lot of information into a small space can, in part, be attributed to Japan being an early adopter of the mobile web. Back when websites were largely brochureware, computer screens, and mobile screens were smaller, the design made sense. But it does not explain why so many sites still appear this way.\\n\\n\\nCultural factors can explain this. Using the 6-D Model, you can see that Japan ranks much higher for Uncertainty Avoidance, meaning that compared to Americans, Japanese are more risk-averse. The text-packed and multi-optioned Yomiuri design is rooted, in part, in risk aversion. Why? One aspect of lowering risk means having as much information as possible available to you to make a decision. It means knowing what you’re getting. Japanese consumers tend to want more information upfront. Print publications also follow this design principle. This is why packaging, adverts, and even television programming can appear confusing and cluttered to the Western eye. While there is some hierarchy to the information presented, the tendency is to utilize space to provide more data points so users can make a fully informed decision.\\n\\n\\nThis is also seen in commercial websites like Rakuten (a popular Japanese affiliate site), where users are routed to other online retailers for cashback on purchases. Visit the site and you’ll see a banner with a carousel of rotating product categories and deals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: \\nrakuten.co.jp\\n\\n\\nScroll down the page and you’ll see a left-hand column of content categories, similar to Yomiuri, with thumbnails of products and promotions. Again, the layout speaks to the risk-averse consumer who needs to weigh all of their options.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompare this to \\nrakuten.com\\n, the US version. It features a single banner, a human figure, and an emotion-driven message. The message is about how cashback makes you feel and less about the tangible benefits of how much you’ll save. The takeaway is the emotional benefit that the brand delivers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeeling the joy’ of Rakuten begins with a single action: downloading the extension. Users scroll down to learn more about how the service works, but the information is minimal. The UX is intended to deliver quick gratification without a lot of data in between. Remember, the US scores 46 on Uncertainty Avoidance, whereas Japan scores 92. That means that as a culture, Americans are more comfortable with uncertainty. US users (for better or worse) are okay not knowing everything before making a decision. In contrast, a Japanese user may be more risk-averse and needs more information before taking any action.\\n\\n\\nAnother difference in design, messaging, and UX is driven by the Individualism measure. The US prizes individualism, with a score of 90 on individualism vs. collectivism. In contrast, Japan puts the collective ahead of the individual, scoring 46 on this measure. Rakuten’s US site features an individual in the banner with a focus on feeling. The emotional needs of the individual are at the core of the message.\\n\\n\\nFinally, you’d expect the combination of the brand promise (joy) and a direct action (the extension download) to be motivating for an Indulgence culture. The US scores 26 points higher on Indulgence than Japan, and this too is reflected in the website design. Gratification promises to be easy and instant.\\n\\n\\nTo further underscore how cross-cultural research can inform design, messaging, and UX, take a look at a global campaign from Gap. The message here is that the brand helps you define yourself, your individuality. However, Japan leans towards Collectivism over Individualism. For Japan, creative localization for this campaign required featuring the family, a form of a collective or in-group, as an expression of individualism.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: \\ngap.com\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: \\ngap.co.jp\\n\\n\\nThe difference in focus on the Individual, Femininity and Indulgence is again evident in Skymark Airlines’ US website. Skymark is a Japanese domestic low-cost airline. Its English language website features a static and visually arresting banner image: a woman looking into a bright blue sky, presumably imagining her travel possibilities. There’s a simple tagline: Your Wing. The image and the copy evoke indulgence, spontaneity, and individualism.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: \\nskymark.jp/en\\n\\n\\nCompare this to Skymark’s local site, which features a rotating banner of rates, destinations, and last-minute deals. This site focuses on providing users with sufficient information to make an informed decision instead of imagining possibilities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: \\nskymark.jp\\n\\n\\nWhen should Cross-Cultural Research be Used\\n\\n\\nThe simple answer is early on, in the discovery phase of a research plan. Multinational brands need to tailor their experiences to meet the culturally ingrained needs and preferences of their customers. The 6-D Model is an excellent starting point. It provides insights into the generalized preferences of a market. A researcher versed in cultural insights can help you understand how those preferences might be manifested with respect to your brand or customer experience and how these needs can be met through your product and user experience. Cross-cultural research is a valuable component of \\nUX research\\n and \\nproduct development\\n. Whatever your objective is, if your audience spans cultures, this approach will help you ‘get it right’ while eliminating the cost of ‘doing it over.’\\n\\n\\nThe 6-D Model is not a magic bullet. The nature of your industry, your competitive environment, and the many non-cultural dimensions of your customers need to be considered. In addition, people adopt multiple roles and identities that can evolve with life stages. And of course, within cultures are sub-cultures. So no, culture isn’t everything. But it is a remarkably powerful, and according to Hofstede, measurable determinant of our preferences and behaviors.\\n\\n\\nInterested in cross-cultural research for your next global project?'}\n","{'Index': 67, 'Heading': 'How to Improve Your Customer Experience Program to Build Relationships and Gather Valuable Insights', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/how-to-improve-your-customer-experience-program-to-build-relationships-and-gather-valuable-insights/', 'Content': 'Three Lessons From the CDC’s V-Safe After Vaccination Health Checker\\n\\n\\nIf you’re not getting the participation or engagement you want from your \\ncustomer experience\\n surveys, a jab in the arm might just give you some inspiration. The CDC has introduced a \\nlongitudinal survey\\n, called the \\nv-safe\\n after vaccination health checker, for those who have received the COVID-19 vaccine. It’s a tool that delivers text messages and web surveys via participants’ smartphone, delivering personalized health check-ins after they have received the vaccine. The tool allows participants to tell the CDC about any symptoms they are experiencing, and depending on the response, may prompt a phone call from the CDC to find out if additional medical assistance is needed.\\n\\n\\nThe study is a reminder that a survey isn’t only a way to collect data—It’s an opportunity to start a conversation, engage your audience, learn more about your customers, and build brand trust. Like the CDC, companies in every industry can create engaging surveys. It all starts with an effective survey design. With surveys designed to entice people to participation, you can collect better data, get better results, and ultimately, see better business outcomes.\\n\\n\\nGet More Value Out of Your Customer Satisfaction Tracker\\n\\n\\nUsing v-safe as an example, here are three lessons on how to conduct an innovative customer experience survey that not only helps you collect better data, but shows customers you value their time and business.\\n\\n\\n1. Start a Conversation by Focusing on What Is Relevant to the Respondent\\n\\n\\nHas a customer representative ever told you that you will get a survey asking you to rate your experience? They may have even suggested that completing the survey helps them out? Chances are you have taken at least a few surveys like this, and the first question you see is a generalized scale question you have seen elsewhere. In this scenario, your priority may change from providing the best answers that you know will satisfy the conditions to complete the survey. You may decide to select neutral options because it doesn’t require significant thought, or you may decide to give the highest response because you believe it will help someone out at the company. Your actual experience becomes secondary to the goal of completing the survey.\\n\\n\\nIn market research, this is known as satisficing. As you can see, satisficing works against the purpose of the survey by degrading the data. While this type of study can deliver critical business metrics, if you are interested in making your survey work for you on a higher level, there is a better way to get the meaningful data you need to move your business forward—you need to start a conversation.\\n\\n\\nNowadays, relationships matter more than ever and surveys can be a tool to help you forge a relationship with the customers as well as gain valuable and actionable insight. If you want respondents to provide thoughtful answers to your survey, you first need to get them interested in what you have to say. That means asking relevant questions. For example, an automotive company that comes out with a new battery electric vehicle (BEV), could survey customers about their experiences for the first six months throughout different points of ownership.\\n\\n\\nTheir first survey question might read: How does your vehicle feel to drive? If the answer is, “Great,” then the follow-up question should be: What felt great about it? Or, if it wasn’t a good experience, the follow-up question should be: “What’s the problem?” Or, “Have you seen a mechanic?”\\n\\n\\nContinue the survey and conversation by asking questions that sound natural. Not only will you keep your customers’ attention, but you’ll show that you are listening and that you’re working hard to improve their experience.\\n\\n\\nThat’s where the CDC tracker gets it right. The first question is a conversation starter. After you register your vaccination on the CDC site, the tracker prompts you for your first health check-in. The survey greets you by name, starting off with the question, “How are you feeling today?” and provides three simple emoji-based answers: Good, Fair and Poor. It’s a question you’d expect from a friend or a caregiver, which makes people want to interact further.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike v-safe, your opening questions should use conversational language and draw customers in to learn about their general feeling with your product, brand, or experience before you ask more in-depth questions.\\n\\n\\n2. Hold Your Survey Experience to the Same High Standards as the Rest of Your Customer Experience\\n\\n\\nNot only should surveys be used to start a conversation, but they should be viewed as an extension of your customer experience and brand relationship. Rather than sending out one survey into the void, it’s critical to make sure your survey is a great experience.\\n\\n\\nIf respondents are happy with your product, explore that. If not, ask questions that help you discover respondent’s issues and how to solve them. As long as questions are fast, conversational and relevant for customers, they will enjoy the survey and provide quality answers. Ultimately, you want the survey experience to be held to the same high standards as all other parts of your customer experience. Here are a couple of ways to you may be able to improve your survey immediately:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAsk simple questions to get better answers:\\n In an effort to cut back survey time and length, some companies ask one complex question rather than two or three simpler questions, but the complex question can be difficult for your customers to answer—leading to frustrating and difficult-to-interpret results. The v-safe survey is a good example of how to streamline your survey questions. The survey asks simple, straightforward questions that can be answered quickly. It then displays additional questions only when relevant. Critically, it does not ask irrelevant or repetitive questions.For example, the v-safe survey asks if the participants feel feverish. If the answer is no, participants move on to the next screen. If yes, a relevant question displays: “Do you know your highest temperature reading for today?’ If yes again, participants are given a text box to type in their temperature. The program uses this technique throughout the survey, which quickly moves participants along.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTake respondents down different paths to gather more insights:\\n Another common practice is to send out a blanket survey with the same questions for every customer. While it may be simpler to send out one survey to everyone, you can collect more data if you ask different questions of different groups within the survey. If you have large sample sizes, you may explore branching paths to collect additional insights without increasing the survey length for individual respondents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Follow Up and Respond to Build a Relationship\\n\\n\\nThe v-safe program ensures an ongoing relationship with participants by sending out a survey every day in the first week after vaccination. It then checks in once a week for up to five weeks to ensure participants are healthy. Furthermore, the survey reminds participants to get their second shot, if relevant, and lets them know that someone may call to check on them depending on their answers. This shows participants that their input is important and generates immediate action.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a second shot is needed, the tracker sends a reminder for a new 6-week check-in process, allowing participants to share their experience just as they did with the first round. Finally, the tracker sends check-ins three, six and 12 months after the final vaccine to find out about any longer-term issues people might be facing.\\n\\n\\nV-safe is just one example of how you can deepen relationships and stay connected with customers by providing them with high-value, frequent interactions built around their experiences. Let’s say you provide a speaker that connects via WiFi. When the customer first receives the speaker, you can survey them around the setup experience. Once they’ve had a chance to use the speaker for a few weeks, ask them about the quality—“How does it sound?” and “Have they had an issues?”\\n\\n\\nBy checking in with customers over time, you can build trust and loyalty, showing them that you value them beyond the sale.\\n\\n\\nRemember, not all studies require a longitudinal approach. In those instances, think about sending a follow-up thank-you note a few months later, perhaps with some details about how the survey helped improve their product. It’s also important to follow up with those who have indicated that they would like you to contact them. Be careful not to imply that you will contact them if you have no intention to do so.\\n\\n\\nStrategic Summary\\n\\n\\nCustomers are giving up valuable time to respond to your survey, so you should design surveys that work for them, and encourage them to give their best answers. Surveys are tools that not only help you collect data, but also strengthen the customer relationship with your brand.\\n\\n\\nWell-designed surveys lead to higher quality data, which then lead to better results, and ultimately better business decisions. At Escalent, we’re giving clients bold, \\ninnovative ways to design their surveys\\n, and we can help you design the best possible survey for your customers and organization.\\n\\n\\nIf you want to learn how you can get more ROI from your customer experience surveys through more thoughtful survey design, send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 68, 'Heading': 'Consumers May Be Slow to Adopt Mobility Tech, but Fleet Decision-Makers Are Ready Despite the Pandemic', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/consumers-may-be-slow-to-adopt-mobility-tech-but-fleet-decision-makers-are-ready-despite-the-pandemic/', 'Content': 'It is no surprise that fleet owners and operators faced considerable challenges in 2020—many of which continue today.

With such network-wide disruption in business operations and demand, one may think conventional wisdom and a return to normal would top the wish list for fleet decision-makers.\\n\\n\\nHowever, these business leaders have embraced the changes, persevered through wild swings in demand, and continue to plan for a new-look future for the industry—one prominently featuring connected and electric vehicles and previously unmatched sources of intelligence to aid in optimizing their business operations.\\n\\n\\nTechnological innovations that require large investments are the easy first casualties when a major market turn or disruption occurs. While it would have been easy—and arguably most logical—to shelve plans for fleet upgrades, owners and operators didn’t waiver in the face of adversity. This is among the key insights we uncovered with our 2021 Fleet Technology Index, the latest report released from \\nFleet Advisory Hub™\\n, which closely examines fleet decision-maker sentiments and adoption plans for an array of transportation and mobility solutions that, taken together, illustrate the future of the fleet industry.\\n\\n\\nWe found that the long-term benefits of modernizing fleet operations are so compelling that significant business contraction in the wake of the pandemic has done very little to slow the consideration and adoption of emerging solutions. In fact, fleet decision-makers’ confidence in the market’s readiness to adopt transformative technologies has increased, with data analytics, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and telematics services leading the way. Artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles lag behind the first tier, while fleet decision-makers’ expectations for drones, mobility services and blockchain are more tempered compared with other tested technologies.\\n\\n\\nFleet operators are particularly bullish on the top three solutions and expect them to reach significant penetration within the next three years:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBEVs: 16% have adopted and 44% are considering.\\n\\n\\nData analytics: 24% have adopted and 35% are considering.\\n\\n\\nTelematics: 17% have adopted and 33% are considering.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMoreover, fleet leaders gravitate to these technologies even more today than they did a year ago.

Whether it’s your logo, your website, your email signature or social media profile, your customers build an impression of your company through every interaction they have with it. Each touchpoint adds up to create your brand image. But in today’s dynamic digital market, customers have more ways than ever to engage with brands.\\n\\n\\nNew and evolving technologies demand that businesses account for the myriad of platforms that can promote as well as demote their brand.\\xa0\\nBrand research\\n\\xa0across a diverse range of markets has shown that your customers’ opinions, needs and expectations can turn on a dime, particularly in the court of social media. As a result, the challenge for businesses is to navigate these platforms to ensure they don’t get lost in the crowd, or worse, stand out for all of the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\\nWhat Is\\xa0the Difference between Brand Identity and Brand Image?\\n\\n\\nBrand identity is the way a business defines itself to their target audience. Every element that helps define your brand, from name and logo to color scheme and even the language you use to communicate with your audience come together to create your overall brand identity.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, your brand image is the perception that customers have of your brand. It is the aggregate of every experience, interaction and association that people have with your organization.\\n\\n\\nWhen customers buy something from your business, they are doing more than just buying a product or service—they are buying into your brand and what it stands for. That’s why it’s vital to ensure that your brand identity consistently says the right thing to each customer. This builds a strong brand image, credibility and loyalty, and, ultimately, provides a strong foundation to help the brand navigate future challenges.\\n\\n\\nTake a look at a few of the world’s biggest brands and you can see the importance of brand image in action. For example, you may not own an Apple product or like the taste of Coca-Cola, but these brands are ubiquitous within today’s culture. Their recognition goes beyond logo or product design to extend to the value of the brands themselves, whether that’s the fun-loving nature of the world’s most popular soda or the user-friendly experience served up by one of the largest technology companies. The history of these companies is not without missteps, but the brands the companies have built and actively maintained allow them to continue to move forward and dominate their markets.\\n\\n\\nThe Benefit of a Strong Brand Image\\n\\n\\nTechnology\\n is changing everything, from something as simple as reading a book to more complex tasks like driving (or not driving) a car. Likewise, modern marketing techniques are affecting the way businesses approach their brand image and perception, and their identity as a whole. The brands that are winning in this ever-changing digital landscape aren’t doing so by accident. Instead, they are using technology to ensure that every interaction their customers have with their brands creates a clear, consistent and coordinated impression.\\n\\n\\nA perfect example of how to do this well can be seen in Nike’s controversial marketing campaign featuring former NFL player Colin Kaepernick that the company launched in 2018. Phil Knight, co-founder and chairman emeritus of Nike, Inc., told \\nFast Company in an interview\\n, “It doesn’t matter how many people hate your brand as long as enough people love it. And as long as you have that attitude, you can’t be afraid of offending people. You can’t try and go down the middle of the road. You have to take a stand on something, which is ultimately I think why the Kaepernick ad worked.”\\n\\n\\nTo Knight’s point, the campaign generated a polarizing response that most brands avoid. It inspired many people to buy Nike shoes, while others burned them. Indeed, there was staunch criticism of the company’s campaign, with viral videos showing customers destroying Nike products and a Maine Republican calling on the electorate to forego the company for one of its competitors. And yet, despite the negative publicity, sales increased by 31% after the campaign went live. This proves\\n that Nike not only understands its brand image, but how it can actively manage its image to authentically live its brand mission, connect with consumers and boost its business.\\n\\n\\nFast forward to 2021, not only did the brand’s sales increase, but it has seen its reputation with the general public consistently \\nimprove over the past couple of years\\n. Leadership attributes the strength of the brand in large part to the Kaepernick campaign and its long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion in the communities it serves. Nike has continued to take bold action as seen with the 2020 “\\nFor Once, Don’t Do It\\n” campaign it launched in response to the widespread protests following the murder of George Floyd. While this campaign may not have made as big of a splash, it shows a strength and consistency in message that we can see is resonating with consumers.\\n\\n\\nHow to Manage Your Brand Identity & Brand Image\\n\\n\\nSuccessfully managing your brand identity requires continuously measuring and evaluating your business’ brand health to ensure that you stay in front of your competitor’s with a positive brand image in the eyes of your current customers and potential audience.\\n\\n\\nThere are six key elements to implementing effective brand management, each of which requires you to answer specific questions about your company, your customers and the market you operate in:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour brand value proposition.\\xa0\\nWhat does your brand bring to the market?\\n\\n\\nTriggers and behavior.\\xa0\\nWhat motivates your customers or prospects to use your product or service?\\n\\n\\nAwareness and consideration.\\xa0\\nHow well-known and -liked is your brand? And how strong are your competitors’ brands?\\n\\n\\nPerception of your brand.\\xa0\\nYou can’t do everything, so what is it that matters to your most receptive customers?\\n\\n\\nEngagement and experience.\\xa0\\nHow frequently are your customers engaging with your brand and does their experience match what your brand promises?\\n\\n\\nLoyalty and retention.\\xa0\\nWhat motivates loyal customers?

Some Electric Vehicle Shoppers Think So', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/would-tesla-be-better-off-without-elon-musk-some-electric-vehicle-shoppers-think-so/', 'Content': 'For many automotive industry observers and commentators, Tesla and Elon Musk likely seem entirely synonymous. Musk is visible and outspoken, frequently defending the Tesla brand from criticism or sharing its latest news himself on Twitter. By the same token, one may surmise that electric vehicle (EV) shoppers perceive the brand in much the same way—intertwined with Musk—and make purchase decisions based on their love for Tesla, Elon or both.\\n\\n\\nWe recently asked EV shoppers what drives their consideration when it comes to deciding on a new vehicle—including what drives their consideration of Tesla, in particular. The top five attributes identified by EV shoppers as driving their consideration of the brand include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRange\\n\\n\\nPerformance and acceleration\\n\\n\\nStyling\\n\\n\\nBuild quality\\n\\n\\nVehicles are new and different\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotably absent? Love for the Tesla brand itself or Elon Musk. The core attributes of Tesla’s product lineup continue to draw people in—something the old guard of automotive manufacturing should keep in mind when designing, building and marketing the enormous wave of EVs slated to hit dealer lots over the next decade.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to the factors that drive consideration for Tesla, we wanted to understand what about the brand or its products give shoppers pause. Among the top detractors? Elon Musk. Further, Musk is the most negative aspect of the Tesla brand among both Tesla owners and other EV owners, ranking above EV driving range, purchase price, build quality and Supercharger availability. Even among non-EV owners, Musk ranks just behind range and purchase price.\\n\\n\\nWhile traditional automakers have been looking for the solution to the EV puzzle, it’s been right under their noses all along. They don’t need to find ways to replicate Tesla’s “secret sauce” or the “Elon Effect”—they just need to demonstrate a genuine commitment to making great electric vehicles with the features shoppers want. Ultimately, it’s something many of them have already done for the better part of a century for their gas-powered products.\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more?

A worried person sees a problem, and a concerned person solves a problem.” —\\nHarold Stephens\\n\\n\\nWorrying is a classic Virgo trait so I blame it on astrology, but it is a trait that does not serve me well. Years ago, the death of a loved one, a divorce, and a recession within a short span of time kicked my elite worrying skills into high gear, and I was scared. But this personal disruption trifecta forced me to make a choice: continue worrying about the future or take action to shape it. I chose the latter—frankly, the former sounded exhausting—and have spent the last 10+ years learning how to embrace change and the discomfort that comes with it. Fun, right?\\n\\n\\nOn a far grander scale, the same is true in business as companies prepare for a post-COVID-19 world and its profoundly disrupted economy and society. The enormity of change—and the uncertainty of how long it will last—is forcing companies to analyze how they are weathering the storm and what that may indicate for their long-term viability. Some have or are learning to adapt and thrive; others may be facing imminent consolidation. Whatever the future holds—reinvention, an acceleration of merger and acquisition activity, or the formation of new partnerships and alliances—one thing is certain: professionals need to decide if they are going to worry about the future or take action to shape it.\\n\\n\\nHeroes & Worriers\\n\\n\\nLike most industries, the pandemic has had a profound impact on market research. Firms like Escalent found themselves rethinking every aspect of their businesses while pivoting in real time to take care of clients, whether protecting the steady flow of insights they rely on to make critical decisions or providing counsel in dozens of industries on short-, medium-, and long-term strategies to prepare for the twists and turns of the recovery.\\n\\n\\nIn what turned out to be oddly prescient, Escalent had recently rebranded after Market Strategies International and Morpace were acquired and merged. As we embarked on our rebranding journey, we recognized that real transformation begins with a willingness to learn from the outside-in as well as a desire to identify which behaviors to aspire to and which to leave behind. One of our goals was to understand the top concerns that were keeping our clients awake at night to reveal where we could provide the greatest value. Not surprisingly, staying ahead of industry disruption was in the top three, but what was fascinating were the two distinct personas that emerged among the professionals: The Hero and The Worrier.\\n\\n\\nThe Heroes are motivated by being challenged and inspired. These professionals need to push their thinking, and they want to grow their career and influence within their company. The Worriers are motivated by getting their day-to-day work done. They need to take things off their mind (and plate), and they want to go home at the end of each day not thinking about work.\\n\\n\\nIt’s interesting to think about these personas from a human behavior perspective, specifically psychological inertia, which is “the tendency to maintain the status quo unless compelled by a psychological motive to intervene or reject it.” Psychological inertia is very common in the workplace. Heroes embrace change, but change triggers fear and anxiety in Worriers. And while this is a natural response, doing what you’ve always done and expecting to remain relevant while everything around you is changing is orders of magnitude riskier than learning to adapt.\\n\\n\\nThe Courage to Embrace Change\\n\\n\\nChange can be scary but not adapting to a changing world is scarier.\\n\\n\\nLike everyone, we are hopeful that 2021 will bring with it healing and a return to a more normal state, whatever that may look like. Having managed change many times over not only in the market research industry but in the industries we serve, Escalent has amassed significant expertise helping companies navigate industry disruption and business transformation. We know how to tell stories that transform data and insights into a profound understanding of what drives human beings. And we help businesses turn those drivers into actions that build brands, enhance customer experiences, and inspire product innovation.\\n\\n\\nMy humble advice? If something scares you, run toward it. Action helps eliminate fear, and it’s a sure sign that you’re growing. Also, it’s important to know you don’t have to go it alone—I’m fairly certain I was responsible for my therapist’s new home theater. And while Escalent doesn’t provide therapy per se, we can be a great partner.

While taking on your own research projects is less expensive than bringing in an external research company, what happens if you hit a roadblock? Engaging a research company at that point would be too costly—and the research company would likely only take on the business if they could take over the entire project, right?\\n\\n\\nAt Escalent, we have a different perspective. We respect your initiative and your ability to carry your project through. But we’ve seen many companies that hit a snag somewhere in the middle of the process, and need help getting their project back on track. That’s why we offer right-sized partnering. We make it easy by setting up a retainer agreement so we can step in, assess and correct the issue that’s blocking your progress, and then step back and let you finish your project.\\n\\n\\nHere are three areas where we’ve seen clients struggle, and how we can help keep projects moving in the right direction.\\n\\n\\nGet started with the right tools and information\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to gathering information from clients, it can be challenging to get exactly what you need. A little training can go a long way to get your research off the ground and make sure you’re ready to navigate the process. We can coach your team on how to listen to clients, collect information, avoid taking the offensive, and take action only after your client’s voice has been heard.\\n\\n\\nCase study:\\n A major tech company felt their product planning team wasn’t close enough to their customers to understand their needs. Because team members weren’t trained on how to effectively communicate with customers, they would dive into technical conversations without taking the time to listen to clients. Escalent was brought in to help prepare the team for this new task, moderating \\nqualitative\\n interviews to encourage dialogue. (\\nRead how we are managing qualitative research during the pandemic\\n.)\\n\\n\\nAs a result, the company’s product planning team had much more open conversations with clients, and learned to gather feedback without becoming defensive. This allowed for stronger connections and more productive relationships—ultimately leading to better service and stronger loyalty.\\n\\n\\nEngage clients at a deeper level for real insight\\n\\n\\nThe most effective case studies start with uncovering the client’s story. But getting clients to open up isn’t easy. We can help you make the one-to-one connections that get conversations started. For example, we can assist with moderating and interviewing clients to draw out the most relevant information and more compelling stories.\\n\\n\\nCase study: \\nA major technology company was building video case studies and needed the participants to be at ease in front of the camera so they could tell a compelling story. Because we knew the audience and topic so well, we stepped in to help participants feel comfortable enough to tell their story.\\n\\n\\nWe used our moderation skills to open up participants and draw out not only emotion and passion, but facts as well. This resulted in videos that created a deeper connection with the subjects and subject matter, drawing viewers into the story and creating more compelling, convincing case studies.\\n\\n\\nWrite effective questionnaires\\n\\n\\nUsing a self-service platform to develop your questionnaires can be a great tool. However, you might still struggle with figuring out your questions and what the answers actually mean, or cleaning up and analyzing your data.\\n\\n\\nHere are some guidelines when writing questions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse terms your audience would understand and avoid jargon\\n\\n\\nWrite clear, concise questions that can only be interpreted one way\\n\\n\\nProvide response options that are mutually exclusive and lead to a clear and accurate interpretation\\n\\n\\nAvoid asking about the same topic over multiple overlapping questions, causing respondents to lose interest (or even quit the survey)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe can provide training and coaching to help you better understand how you should structure your questionnaire, which language to use, how to incorporate instructions, and how to use survey platforms. On the data side, we can train you on what to do if you’re not getting the quality data you expect.\\n\\n\\nYour Business, Your Choice\\n\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of where we see clients getting stuck, and where we can help.

Many industries have found ways to make it work with the help of technology. This is particularly true for our clients who want to conduct \\nqualitative research\\n. How we can make it work and provide effective insights while keeping our clients and participants safe has been one of our top priorities.\\n\\n\\nSetting Priorities\\n\\n\\nWe engage with thousands of people each year as we conduct research around the world. In many cases, we are privileged to meet with participants in-person, as we conduct ethnographies in their homes or invite them to research facilities to tell their stories and discuss their needs. In some cases, particularly when fielding health-related studies, we come into contact with those who are among the most vulnerable to viral and respiratory infections.\\n\\n\\nIn March of 2020, when COVID-19 turned the US and the rest of the world upside down, our team at Escalent gathered to discuss the key needs and priorities for how we would handle the developing travel restrictions and fielding challenges that would emerge if the situation escalated. The priority for every team member was simple and unanimous: \\nWe will not put clients and participants at risk.\\n There is no research objective that outweighs personal safety.\\n\\n\\nIn collaboration with our clients, we put approaches in place that limit the need for respondents to participate in in-person research.\\n\\n\\nMeeting the Challenge\\n\\n\\nThe fact remains that despite, and in some cases, because of, the obstacles COVID-19 has put in our way, there are critical business challenges that need to be addressed for many companies, so we consistently revisit and adapt our approaches in response to the evolving situation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeveraging Technology:\\n While not every country and market has fully adopted the use of webcam interviews or online boards for research, these circumstances present a unique opportunity to demonstrate the technology’s value and explore larger-scale feasibility. We are utilizing a combination of online discussion boards and webcam interviews for many of the projects that we would traditionally conduct in-person. We work with our international partners to recruit appropriately, educate respondents and refine our engagement strategies to maximize completions.\\n\\n\\nEvolving the Debrief:\\n For our client teams that thrive through live, backroom discussion, it is difficult to imagine the same immersion in global research without the “boots on the ground” element. We’ve opted to take many of the same engagement strategies that keep our remote teams connected and use them to help our clients stay connected to the research. From simple tactics such as carefully scheduled calls (to address conflicting time zones) to creative options such as using asynchronous online boards (to allow teams to post questions, collaborate on stimuli updates and share their learning), we are working closely with our client teams, translators and international moderators to bring global research home.\\n\\n\\nCollaborating Virtually:\\n While it’s difficult to replace in-person engagements, we’ve found that a well-facilitated session using a virtual collaboration platform yields impressive results. We’ve combined aspects of gamification with interactive exercises and informative, eye-catching visuals to create a participant- or client-collaboration environment that is as effective as if we were face-to-face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor any in-person research (regardless of industry or audience), we require our research facility partners to commit to following our in-person research protocol, which we developed in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic. Some of the highlights include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScreening participants for symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing) before entering the facility\\n\\n\\nOffering tele-web interviews with flexible hours and availability to any participants who are not comfortable coming in, may have been exposed to COVID-19, or report potential symptoms of infection\\n\\n\\nProviding an isolated waiting area for participants or staff who exhibit COVID-19-related symptoms\\n\\n\\nElevating the degree of cleaning and sanitization of all high-contact surfaces, interview rooms, waiting areas, backrooms, restrooms and public areas\\n\\n\\nRequiring sick employees to stay home, particularly those who develop respiratory symptoms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinding A Way to Move Forward\\n\\n\\nThe research industry has encountered and dealt with many crises over the years that have impeded travel, such as natural disasters, political upheaval and international conflict. And, while timelines may shift, we always find a way to gather the insights needed to drive critical decision-making for our clients.\\n\\n\\nWhile qualitative research helps us to deeply understand peoples’ lives, thoughts and behavior, we must ensure that our research design, practices and logistics always keep our participants and employees safe. On the average day, this is important out of respect for their time and effort—but in the midst of a health crisis, it is essential for their safety and well-being.\\n\\n\\nSend us a note\\n if you would like to discuss how to keep your global research moving amid these challenges, and leverage our creative strategies for fielding and engagement.'}\n","{'Index': 74, 'Heading': 'The Great Divide in Millennials: Why Brands Shouldn’t Lump Them Together', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/the-great-divide-in-millennials-why-brands-shouldnt-lump-them-together/', 'Content': 'For years, brands have been talking about how millennials are different from other generations and require a unique approach to messaging, advertising, product development and purchase experiences. millennials—born between 1980 and 1996—were the trendsetters, and brands have invested in countless ways to capture their attention and loyalty, shifting with them as their needs and the world’s technology have changed.\\n\\n\\nBut are all millennials really the same?\\n\\n\\nWe know from articles in recent years that the oldest millennials often feel like they don’t quite fit in with the media’s portrayal of their generation. Yet many brands still lump all millennials together by values, motivations and behaviors when developing marketing and communication plans.\\n\\n\\nThat’s a lost opportunity, and here’s why:\\n\\n\\nIn a recent generational study, Escalent set out to learn more about the needs and values of different cohorts within the millennial generation. \\nOur hypothesis was that the age of millennials during the Great Recession—late 2007 to mid-2009—is a dividing factor for how millennials approach the world.\\n For example, millennials in or entering the workforce during that time would have viewed things differently from their middle school- and high school-aged counterparts.\\n\\n\\nWe found that there are, in fact, nuances between younger (age 23-31) and older (age 32-38) millennials that impact how brands should approach and communicate with this generation. Interestingly, by comparing millennials in a different way, the results also shed light on how brands can better prepare for the influx of Gen Z to the marketplace.\\n\\n\\nDuring the current global health and economic crisis, it is all the more important for brands to understand the nuances between the two cohorts within the millennial generation and Gen Z trends. Here are our findings, along with recommendations for how brands can ensure they’re delivering the right messages to the right people.\\n\\n\\nDifferent Events Have Influenced Different Millennials\\n\\n\\nOlder millennials entered or were in the workforce in the throes of the Great Recession. High unemployment and stagnant wages led to a financial crisis that slowed down their earning potential, saddled them with high student debt, and affected their life choices for years to come. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, older millennials are being transported back to the Great Recession, and acting accordingly by limiting their spending and consumption habits to pay for necessities. Younger millennials may finally understand just what their older counterparts went through as they all navigate the current crisis. Furthermore, older Gen Z are finding themselves in a \\nsimilar situation to older millennials\\n during the Great Recession—graduating from college with a lot of student loan debt and entering the workforce while the world is crippled by pandemic-related restrictions, high unemployment rates and extreme economic uncertainty.\\n\\n\\nTechnology is another factor that has shaped the lives of millennials, in particular. Because technology has changed so rapidly over the years, there’s a big difference in culture and lifestyle between the youngest and the oldest millennials. For example, younger millennials grew up with the Internet and social media, whereas these technologies didn’t become a part of the lifestyle of older millennials until they became adults. In fact, older millennials have been grouped with the youngest Gen Xers in a microgeneration called \\nXennials\\n. Born in the late 70’s to early 80’s, this group is said to have had an analog childhood and a digital adulthood. With a majority of the country grappling with varying levels of in-person restrictions and remote work, people of all generations are turning to different technologies to bridge the social distancing gap and maintain communication and connection—technologies with which Gen Z and younger millennials are well accustomed to regularly using.\\n\\n\\nBrand Love and Loyalty\\n\\n\\nBrand love and loyalty is not the same across all millennials. While many articles lament the \\nloss of loyalty among millennials\\n, our research shows that older millennials have a significant amount of brand loyalty and brand love. This includes paying more for their favorite brands, and sticking with a brand once they’ve found one they like.\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, we found that Gen Zs appear to be like the younger, less loyal millennials. In fact, our data show a steady decline from older millennials to younger Gen Z across various brand love and loyalty measures.\\n\\n\\nOlder millennials (age 32-38 in 2019) have the most brand love and loyalty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConfidence and Connection\\n\\n\\nAccording to our research, older millennials feel more connected to products they buy and use, and are more self-assured and confident in what they want than their younger cohorts. Although confidence may come with age, we believe it ties more closely to brand behavior and loyalty. If someone feels connected and has more brand love, they’re more likely to be invested personally and stick with that brand.\\n\\n\\nThe data show that while older millennials stand apart on these issues, Gen Z are following patterns of younger millennials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Brands Can Reach Millennials More Effectively\\n\\n\\nIt’s important to recognize that just because millennials are grouped in the same generation, they’re not all the same people—especially when it comes to brand loyalty. You need to think about more than just the generation and take into account the cultural and economic shifts that happened and shaped millennials.\\n\\n\\nHere are three recommendations for brands to keep in mind:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdjust your strategy:\\n If your target is all millennials, you need a two-prong strategy to reach both older and younger members of the group.\\n\\n\\nChange up your tone:\\n Adjust your tone to match the values and preferences of older and younger millennials so your message doesn’t fall flat.\\n\\n\\nModify your messaging:\\n Target your messaging accordingly for each cohort. For example, older millennials want messaging that makes them feel connected to a product and reflects their core values.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSharpen Your Brand Communication\\n\\n\\nOlder and younger millennials aren’t so drastically different that they are different generations. However, there are definite nuances you should be aware of that can help your marketing become more effective. Both younger and older millennials will require a different strategy and tone when it comes to communicating with them and establishing brand love and loyalty. You’ll have to prove the need for loyalty to younger millennials while older millennials are more naturally inclined to be loyal to your brand.\\n\\n\\nAs for Gen Z, they’re still defining themselves and are following in the footsteps of younger millennials. By tweaking your approach to strategy, tone and messaging, you’ll go a long way in establishing the trust needed to keep these important generations coming back again and again to your brand.\\n\\n\\nSend us a note\\n to learn how Escalent can help you better understand your audiences and adjust your \\nbrand messaging\\n strategy accordingly.\\n\\n\\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of 1004 consumers aged 13 to 38 between June 25 to July 2, 2019.

The \\nfirst entry\\n covered telematics adoption rates and patterns while the \\nsecond article\\n\\xa0discussed the critical issue of retention.\\n\\n\\nData analytics and the promise of leveraging insights generated by Big Data have the potential to radically redefine fleet management and significantly improve business performance like never before. Today, connected vehicles are increasingly smarter through advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and highly automated features designed to improve safety and mitigate risks for the fleet company.\\n\\n\\nKey Insights and Takeaways\\n\\n\\nHowever, as the \\n2020 Commercial Fleet Telematics and Data Analytics report \\nreveals—the newest release in an ongoing series of forward-looking fleet technology publications from Escalent’s \\nFleet Advisory Hub\\n—capitalizing on growth opportunities for the providers in this space is a complex proposition, demanding both a nuanced understanding of the pressures, preferences and priorities of commercial and fleet vehicle decision-makers, and the ability to deploy products and services that solve real-world problems. Making that happen will require a commitment to educate on the value of leveraging more of a company’s data assets as well as the ability to demonstrate financial outcomes with relevant use cases.\\n\\n\\nProviders will need to tailor product and service-related communication around pertinent challenges and missed opportunities to gain the attention of key fleet decision–makers:\\n\\n\\nGoals and Growth\\n\\n\\nFor adopters, motivations for integrating data analytics into the business management process are rooted in cost reduction and improved fleet performance. However, the decision to invest in integrating data analytics and the associated process goes beyond the standard quest to save money. It’s also part of a longer-term strategic shift that involves thinking about the business differently and pursuing opportunities to identify areas of innovation. Providers that can demonstrate compelling, successful real-world use cases can help drive that shift.\\n\\n\\nUncertainties and Concerns\\n\\n\\nThere are, however, a proportion of potential adopters who remain uncertain about their ability to manage and fully leverage various streams of data. To ensure fleets integrate and do not abandon data-driven solutions, it is vital for providers to understand the nuances and changing perceptions of data overload—and the specific actions they can take to address data management and utilization challenges.\\n\\n\\nData Overload: Overblown?\\n\\n\\nWhile concerns about data overload (the inability to use or optimize large volumes of captured data) are often discussed in the industry, fewer than one-third of adopters report experiencing the phenomenon. In fact, slightly more report \\nno \\nissues than those who say they can be overwhelmed. Addressing the concerns of those in the latter group remains a priority, however, as the risk for underuse or abandonment of data-centric solutions is higher. Data overload has been mitigated by using providers’ core dashboards, and further, by implementing custom solutions for individual companies that consistently provide information that can be used to affect business outcomes and demonstrate ROI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPriorities and Partnerships\\n\\n\\nConsequently, providers need to be highly engaged and proactive in educating fleets on the management and application of their various data streams. This consultative relationship will be increasingly important with even more data produced in the future. Providers also need to understand adopters’ data analytics priorities and overall fleet objectives, and adapt pursuit and positioning strategies accordingly. For example, while fleet size is not a determinant of proficiency or competency for managing and using data, there are differing priorities. Large fleets, for instance, tend to be more concerned about data security.\\n\\n\\nMeaningful Solutions\\n\\n\\nProviders would be wise to identify and capitalize on opportunities to partner with companies to improve their data management. Such partnerships present an opportunity for providers to elevate their status and deliver problem-solving consultative service in the pursuit of securing brand loyalty and becoming a trusted advisor. These types of efforts will increase data program implementation and generate a significant number of revenue opportunities for service providers that can guide commercial and fleet businesses in a proactive, turnkey manner that clearly demonstrates value.\\n\\n\\nAchieving Success with a Data-Driven, Decision-Making Framework\\n\\n\\nIn closing, we’d like you leave you with three steps, tailored from Escalent’s \\nDataDialogue™\\n data-driven, decision-making framework to consider, that can be leveraged by both fleet businesses and service providers to overcome data overload and collaborate toward mutually beneficial engagements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrioritize business challenges to focus on solving priority business objectives and problems; if everything is important at once, nothing is.\\n\\n\\nIdentify pertinent, problem-specific data and business rules as well as any required additional contextual understanding that will be leveraged to support the analytical framework for solving the business problem.\\n\\n\\nConduct the analysis to identify factors contributing to the business issue, determine and take actions to solve the business problem—monitoring the framework regularly to prevent reoccurrence (automate as able), while moving on to solving the next-level priority business issues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to know more about Fleet Advisory Hub or DataDialogue™, or talk about how Escalent can help your business embrace and promote a data-driven mindset, please send us a note.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Fleet Advisory Hub™\\n\\n\\nThe results reported come from our 2020 third quarter report on telematics and data analytics, comprising a subset of commercial and fleet vehicle decision-makers drawn from the Fleet Advisory Hub audience.

This installment explores the critical issue of retention: delivering essential insights into post-adoption strategies for retention and value optimization. The \\nfirst entry\\n covered telematics adoption rates and patterns—and implications for the industry going forward.\\n\\n\\nWith the release of the \\n2020 Commercial Fleet Telematics and Data Analytics report\\n, the latest in a series of forward-looking fleet technology publications from Escalent’s \\nFleet Advisory Hub\\n, product manufacturers and service providers in this fast-growing space have received critical information about the current state of the marketplace—and the attitudes, aspirations and actions of commercial and fleet vehicle decision-makers.\\n\\n\\nKey Insights and Takeaways\\n\\n\\nThe good news is that commercial vehicle telematics adopters currently have a defection rate of less than one in ten. Taking a closer look at adoption patterns and retention rates reveals some fascinating and potentially important patterns that providers should be aware of. Perhaps most notably, large fleets lead the adoption curve (more than half have pilot tested or integrated a telematics solution into their fleet) and, due to less experience, smaller fleets are substantially less likely to view telematics as an important fleet management asset—and, consequently, have lower adoption rates (around 25% of small and medium fleets and just 6% of micro fleets). While satisfaction with implemented telematics solutions is generally high, defectors \\nare\\n more likely to be micro and small fleets (almost half of defectors represent micro fleets).\\n\\n\\nOur report has uncovered some of the reasons for these technology abandonment patterns and what might be done to mitigate them:\\n\\n\\nAccurately Identifying and Addressing Priorities and Areas of Concern\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding and addressing the needs of commercial and fleet vehicle decision-makers begins by considering the factors that play into defection decisions. Acknowledging the unique challenges of fleets and connecting with decision-makers on a more personal level are important, and that empathy needs to be front and center in the sales, marketing and after-sales support process.\\n\\n\\nCost is a significant factor in the decision to defect, particularly among micro fleets, which tend to be more sensitive to economic fluctuations. With that in mind, establishing a longer-view ROI metric (favored over a more absolute investment expense) can and should be viewed as critical to limiting defection of telematics and data analytics programs. ROI metrics should be more than just a sales tool, but rather a key element of a robust and sustained retention program. Appropriate objective-based metrics allow decision-makers to fully understand both the savings and incremental revenue that are being generated. While specific objectives of telematics and data analytics programs vary, increasing fleet productivity and vehicle use is a universal priority of all fleets, as is improving maintenance scheduling. Micro fleets, however, place higher value on reducing fuel spend and unnecessary miles driven, while larger fleets prioritize labor cost management. Medium fleets value increasing uptime and improving vehicle tracking.

For the near term, it will continue to be critical for providers to demonstrate and reinforce how these technologies and solutions can be leveraged to deliver value for adopters’ specific businesses and applications. For the longer term, it will be important to exhibit how telematics applications differ and continue to add value, as the industry moves toward advancements in transportation such as electrification, shared services and autonomy.

This installment covers telematics adoption rates and patterns—and implications for the industry going forward.\\n\\n\\nAt a time when transformative new tools and technologies are profoundly disrupting the commercial and fleet vehicle industry, product manufacturers and service providers need to rise to the challenge of meeting equally-dynamic customer needs and expectations.\\n\\n\\nThe \\n2020 Commercial Fleet Telematics and Data Analytics report\\n, the latest in a series of forward-looking fleet technology publications from Escalent’s \\nFleet Advisory Hub\\n, is designed to help make sure that happens. The report reveals critical new information about attitudes, adoption and use patterns regarding telematics and data analytics solutions, offering insights and timely analyses gleaned directly from commercial and fleet vehicle decision-makers. Given the projected explosive growth of the global commercial vehicle telematics market in the next decade, understanding the perspectives, patterns and priorities of decision-makers could significantly impact businesses and bottom lines.\\n\\n\\nKey Insights and Takeaways\\n\\n\\nThe headlines from the newest findings begin with low adoption rates for telematics and data analytics solutions among commercial and fleet vehicle decision-makers. Currently, just 15% of fleets surveyed have adopted telematics solutions—primarily due to regulations (such as with trucking and transportation in response to Electronic Logging Devices mandates) or larger fleets looking to leverage economies of scale for increased return on their investments.\\n\\n\\nDigging deeper into the data reveals intriguing nuances and important opportunities behind the headlines:\\n\\n\\nEnormous Opportunity\\n\\n\\nWhile 15% represents a low market penetration, close to half (44%) of fleet decision-makers are actively shopping for telematics solutions—including 55% of those leading operations with 6–50 vehicles. Many decision-makers who have not yet adopted a solution are considering how to prepare their business for integration. The relatively low rate of adoption, in conjunction with a comparatively high rate of active shoppers and a general openness to the technology, reveals a market poised to explode.\\n\\n\\nThink Big by Going Small\\n\\n\\nSmall fleets are an especially promising target. They have a familiarity with telematics and their understanding of the importance of the technology mirrors that of medium and large fleets, which currently lead the adoption curve. This also presents a promising opportunity for commercial and fleet vehicle dealers, as more small fleets prefer to acquire telematics solutions from vehicle manufacturers and dealers.\\n\\n\\nNo Substitute for Hands-On Experience \\n\\n\\nExhibiting value is key to driving adoption. Recognition of the importance of telematics’ role in managing the business nearly triples when knowledge of telematics solutions improves. Remarkably, 90% of fleet leaders \\nwith\\n hands-on telematics experience rate the technology as “extremely important” or “somewhat important” to managing their business. That’s an excellent sign—and one that bodes well for the future of the market—assuming providers can bridge the experience gap and continue to find ways to demonstrate the value of their products, both before and during implementation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBridging the Gap\\n\\n\\nProviders must find bold and innovative ways to connect and communicate with prospective adopters—and must go beyond traditional marketing and transactional sales models. To capitalize on growth opportunities in this space, providers should leverage fleet vehicle manufacturers’ distribution networks to partner with fleets, and demonstrate their commitment to the success of their customers’ business. Vehicle manufacturers and dealers are most trusted by fleet decision-makers; dealers can be excellent educators when describing specific features and adept at establishing personal relationships that evolve into a trusted advisor role.\\n\\n\\nROI-Driven Adoption\\n\\n\\nIn the months and years ahead, providers looking to drive adoption need to continue to increase exposure and experience among fleet decision-makers—and to show decision-makers how telematics and data analytics solutions can improve their fleet’s efficiency, effectiveness and overall profitability. Tangible use cases and coaching for a data-driven management model—including the compelling case that adopters typically see increased ROI the longer they stick with telematics solutions—are effective in making that happen.\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to know more about Fleet Advisory Hub or discuss how we can help you increase fleet adoption of telematics and data analytics solutions, please send us a note.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo read the second article in this series about telematics and data analytics service retention, click \\nhere\\n.\\n\\n\\nAbout Fleet Advisory Hub™\\n\\n\\nThe results reported come from our 2020 third quarter report on telematics and data analytics, comprising a subset of commercial and fleet vehicle decision-makers drawn from the Fleet Advisory Hub audience.

Honestly, at the time, I was not sure what to make of it but, now, I can confidently say it feels like a roller coaster ride of a lifetime. The anticipation of a world with self-driving cars is absolutely exhilarating. But, at the same time, unexpected twists and turns detract from the excitement of the journey and cast an ominous cloud of doubt over the realization of self-driving vehicles.\\n\\n\\nGrowing Industry Momentum for AVs Despite Low Consumer Demand\\n\\n\\nRecently, there has been a lot of activity in the world of autonomous vehicles (AV). Important players are building momentum as they diligently ascend the massive incline to be among the leaders to offer a self-driving vehicle that is not only accepted but embraced by the public.\\n\\n\\nWaymo recently announced it is \\ngoing fully driverless\\n, meaning no safety driver on board. General Motor’s Cruise was recently awarded a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to \\ntest five fully driverless vehicles\\n on public roads in San Francisco. Of course, we can’t forget about Tesla, which recently released its \\nFull Self-Driving software\\n to a limited group of owners who are willing to give the beta version a try. The release of the over-the-air software may be to the chagrin of other drivers who have to share the road with these brave Tesla trailblazers.\\n\\n\\nIf this isn’t exciting—or perhaps scary—enough, there is a broad range of AV developments underway targeted for commercial applications. This includes last-mile delivery of goods, groceries and medicine on one end of the spectrum to autonomous long-haul trucking on the other end. The recent partnership between \\nWaymo and Daimler Trucks\\n speaks to the viability of launching such commercial applications. Building on this momentum, Ford has announced it is targeting 2022 to launch an \\nautonomous commercial business\\n in partnership with Argo AI using Ford Escape Hybrids.\\n\\n\\nIt is so exciting to witness these innovative players achieve such impressive milestones, which are definitely poised to redefine mobility. Interestingly, however, the momentum in development is not in response to consumer demand for self-driving vehicles.\\n\\n\\nLacking Consumer Enthusiasm and Trust in AVs\\n\\n\\nEscalent has been tracking consumer sentiment towards self-driving vehicles for years and little has changed. Only about 1-in-10 have a very positive opinion of self-driving vehicles and are completely comfortable riding in an autonomous vehicle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis absence of enthusiasm is not a reflection of awareness, as most people (81%) have heard or seen at least something about the development of self-driving cars (67% have heard something/14% have heard a lot).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is about a lack of trust in the technology. People are not convinced that the technology will keep them and their loved ones safe from harm. The most important topics consumers want to learn about are the safety record/test results of the AV and how vehicle occupants will be safe while riding in it.\\n\\n\\nQuantifying the Lift in Positive Consumer Attitudes towards AVs through Education\\n\\n\\nOur research also speaks to the importance of educating the public about the technology and the impact these efforts have on improving consumer attitudes toward AVs. The proportion of people who have a positive opinion of AVs is \\n2.5 times greater\\n among those who have seen or heard “a lot” of information about self-driving vehicles compared to those who have seen or heard “some” information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA similar story emerges for being open to riding in a self-driving vehicle. Those who are more knowledgeable about AVs are more likely to be open to riding in a self-driving vehicle by a \\nfactor of 3:1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding the Multi-Dimensional Aspect of Trust is Critical for Building Acceptance\\n\\n\\nAs important as education is to adoption, education alone won’t be enough. Companies need to have a multi-stage strategy that is cost efficient and highly effective in earning the public’s trust. This will be no small feat as trust, as a construct, is complex.\\n\\n\\nIn the race to earn people’s trust, AV companies need to account for the multi-dimensional aspect of trust to ensure a leadership position. Building trust in AVs is a process that is influenced by several factors including: pre-existing knowledge, personal experience, situational factors, demographics and culture, as well as personality traits.\\n\\n\\nEducation campaigns, human-machine interface (HMI) design and human-robot interactions (HRI) must take into consideration how this constellation of factors express themselves across various segments of consumers. The level of vulnerability felt by a mother with small children riding in an AV is likely to be quite different than for a young man out on the town with his buddies. As such, education messaging, marketing communications, and interior and exterior design of AVs must be reflective of how different people interpret information and behave during interactions with a self-driving vehicle powered by artificial intelligence. Designing through this lens will enable trust, thus leading to acceptance and adoption of self-driving vehicles.\\n\\n\\nBuilding Trust in Autonomous Technology Is This Decade’s Challenge\\n\\n\\nAs AV innovators renew their efforts for the years to come, it is not too early to start the process of building trust in AV technology. Earning the public’s trust is about getting the interaction right. In the case of AVs, the interaction is not only with the user/rider—it is also about the interaction with other vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists and infrastructure. In order for people to trust the technology, it’s imperative that companies understand the factors that influence how people come to trust autonomous vehicle technology. It’s important to understand how culture, personality traits and other key factors influence trust so companies can deliver experiences that resonate with a highly diverse audience.\\n\\n\\nGiven the billions of dollars already invested in the next generation of mobility, along with the support of the \\nfederal government\\n, the industry is not likely to abandon its efforts given the huge potential for saving lives and reducing emissions.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to an even more exhilarating roller coaster ride that promises to deliver a cascade of memorable experiences over the next decade of AV development.\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s\\xa0\\nautomotive\\n\\xa0team works with mobility companies of all kinds to craft winning strategies and find success as they navigate disruption and business transformation. If you would like to learn more about how we can help you come out on top in good times and bad, please\\xa0send us a note.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of 1,000 consumers aged 18 and older between September 10 and September 25, 2020.\\xa0Respondents were recruited from the Dynata\\xa0opt-in online panel of US adults and were interviewed online.\\xa0Quotas were put in place to achieve a sample of age, gender, income and ethnicity that matches the demographics of the US population.\\xa0The data have a margin of error of 3 percentage points at a confidence level of 95%.

As someone who spends much of my day designing survey samples and weighting data to ensure representation, the subtle but often important differences in how various pollsters design their polls are a fascinating topic to me.\\n\\n\\nBut after the polls failed to predict the Trump victory in 2016, public trust in political polling took a major hit, as many Americans thought the polls had failed. In 2018, the polls took another hit, after missed predictions in the Ohio and Florida gubernatorial races.\\n\\n\\nPolitical polling has always been a challenge, and the Electoral College makes polling in close presidential races particularly difficult. After each debacle, like \\nThe Literary Digest’s\\n 1936 poll that famously predicted Kansas Governor Alfred Landon would defeat President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and the 1948 Gallup prediction that New York Governor Thomas Dewey would defeat incumbent President Harry Truman, the polling industry has made leaps forward. Random sampling as the industry standard was a reaction to the first miss, and Gallup learned that you don’t stop polling weeks before the actual election. In 2016, the national polls were broadly criticized, despite predictions that were close to the actual margin, with Trump’s chances of winning being estimated at slightly better than the chances of a coin flip coming up heads twice in a row. The issues were primarily with state-level polling, in part because many colleges and polling firms joined the fray as a way of generating earned media.\\n\\n\\nAmerican Skepticism\\n\\n\\nThe 2016 election results showed areas for improvement in polling, and many polling firms took note, but the public has been slow to ‘buy-in’ again. Heading into Election Day 2020, Biden is holding an average 8.6% national lead and is positioned as a 9-1 favorite over President Trump according to FiveThirtyEight, a high-profile poll aggregator. For comparison, Hillary Clinton held a much smaller 3.5-point advantage with a 71% chance of victory according to FiveThirtyEight.\\n\\n\\nDespite signs pointing to a commanding lead by Biden, confidence that Biden will win the presidency is notably lower than it was for Clinton in 2016, with pundits defending against the potential for another high-profile miss that would further erode public trust.\\n\\n\\nWith members of the media, the public and even the candidates themselves expressing doubts about the accuracy of the polls, it begs the question: Should we trust the polls this time? And if the polls are wrong this year, what does that tell us about public opinion polling in general?\\n\\n\\nPolitical Polling Faces Unique Challenges\\n\\n\\nFortunately for market research and other non-political opinion polling, many of the toughest challenges that political polling faces do not apply to other polling in the same way.\\n\\n\\nPolitical pollsters have to contend with significant challenges relating to low social trust of polls and issues of social desirability bias. Low levels of social trust among segments of the electorate lead to both non-response and inaccurate reporting of voting intentions and candidate preferences. Recently, this phenomenon has been dubbed the ‘shy’ Trump voter, also known as the ‘silent majority’.\\n\\n\\nBeyond these issues, mail-in voting is a hot topic, particularly in the all-important battleground state of Pennsylvania where the US Supreme Court may soon decide on the legitimacy of mail-in votes that were mailed before Election Day but received after the polls close on November 3. Furthermore, it is unclear what proportion of mail-in ballots received will be deemed invalid due to issues such as signature mis-matches, failure to use a required privacy sleeve, and other factors.\\n\\n\\nThere are also some wildcard factors to consider leading to Election Day, including spiking COVID-19 cases nationwide, a significant increase in first-time voters, and young voters turning out at higher rates than ever before. There are even some structural changes that polling has never faced like ranked choice voting in Maine.\\n\\n\\nPositive Signs for the 2020 Polls\\n\\n\\nWhile the polls are contending with significant challenges, there are many positive signs that suggest better accuracy this year than what we saw in 2016 or 2018.\\n\\n\\nHigh voter turnout:\\n\\n\\nLeading into the final weekend before Election Day, Texas has already exceeded its 2016 vote totals, suggesting a major increase in voter turnout for 2020. If the trends seen in Texas and other swing states hold, we will see unprecedented voter turnout, mitigating the impact of inaccurate self-reporting of voting behaviors.\\n\\n\\nThe polls have been unusually stable and in agreement with each other:\\n\\n\\nSince June, President Trump’s approval rating and polling averages have held amazingly steady, despite many opportunities for the race to tighten after the presidential and vice presidential debates.\\n\\n\\nThe “October Surprise” fizzled this year:\\n\\n\\nIn 2016, Clinton appeared to suffer more negative fallout from late-breaking scandals than Trump. This year, neither Trump nor Biden seem to be as impacted by stories in the news cycle in the final stretch of their campaigns.\\n\\n\\nUndecided voters:\\n\\n\\nThe proportion of likely voters who are still undecided is reportedly several percentage points lower in 2020 than in 2016. Quite simply, the potential to close the gap is smaller as many Americans have already voted, and most others have decided for whom they will vote.\\n\\n\\nPollsters have gotten smarter:\\n\\n\\nBeyond these encouraging signs for pollsters, many of the most well-known and respected polls have made changes to their methodologies to correct for areas that were previously lacking. Commonly, polls are now incorporating corrections for education and better coverage of cell phone-only households—two factors that contributed to misses in key 2016 swing states.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, innovative techniques for prediction and cross-validation are being put in place in some polls. The USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research, for instance, is not only asking about personal voting intentions this year, but also asking people how they think members of their social circle will vote, and how they think others in their state will vote, as a way to indirectly predict election results in a way that is less subject to false reporting. Time will tell if these techniques will provide consistent and accurate estimates, but new techniques like these illustrate an evolution in polling science.\\n\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\n\\nPolitical polling and market opinion research have grown from the same roots, evolving from learnings made in each field. Today, they continue to address some common challenges facing each industry, including issues of non-response and sampling error. Furthering the challenge, political polling must also contend with voting dynamics that do not impact other types of opinion research. Regardless of how things turn out in the 2020 election, both industries will continue to enhance their techniques and borrow successful strategies from one another to account for the ever-changing world at large.\\n\\n\\nWhile it is not a sure bet that the polls will be correct this year, one thing is for certain: Americans will be glued to their television sets and smartphones on Tuesday, and likely for several days, if not weeks after.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to learn more about the differences between political polling and market research, \\nsend us a note\\n.'}\n","{'Index': 81, 'Heading': 'As EVs Close the Range Gap, Manufacturers Must Turn Their Attention to Time Spent Charging', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/as-evs-close-the-range-gap-manufacturers-must-turn-their-attention-to-time-spent-charging/', 'Content': 'Since their inception, the biggest concern facing the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has been range capability. To this point, range has been the first drawback on everyone’s mind when it comes to EVs, from early adopters making due with the sub-100 mile ranges of the first available EVs to manufacturers downplaying the anxiety and racing to increase battery capacity.\\n\\n\\nHowever, things are changing. Nearly 20 EVs on the market or available soon will boast ranges of 200 miles or more. While that’s still short of the average gas- or diesel-powered vehicle and such range anxiety won’t just disappear, it’s part of the reason EV-curious shoppers are looking past range to other concerns, like time spent at the charging station.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, consumer focus on fast charging has outpaced concerns over public charger availability, with Time Anxiety™ registering twice as important for an improved EV charging experience as the proximity of a charger to the driver’s route.\\n\\n\\nThose are some of our latest findings at Escalent thanks to a recent \\nEVForward™\\n DeepDive, which explored the considerations of EV shoppers across the broad adoption spectrum, from early adopters to those most wary and skeptical of the technology. And, it makes sense: an EV with comparable range to a traditional gas-powered vehicle that also requires a lengthy amount of time to refuel—several times longer than a stop at the gas pump—presents many of the same practicality concerns for shoppers as a vehicle with limited range in the first place.\\n\\n\\nSo, while industry players—including manufacturers, regulators and utility companies, among others—are touting new partnerships and rapidly expanding charger networks, they’re not making the dent into the consideration barrier they want to make. Critically, they need to offer expansive charger networks that prioritize fast charging capabilities. Direct current (DC) fast charging is no longer a “nice-to-have” amenity, it’s a critical deal breaker for many consumers. Ultimately, shortening the time spent charging at a station effectively extends the range of the vehicle—at least, in the eyes of those shelling out their hard earned money on a new vehicle.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about the findings from the latest EVForward™ DeepDive market report, click the button below to watch the 30-minute webinar replay where Automotive & Mobility vice president Mike Dovorany discusses Time Anxiety and several other topics, including the importance of home charging support and the impact of manufacturer warranties for EVs on adoption.'}\n","{'Index': 82, 'Heading': '7 Signs You Need a Dashboard Strategy', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/7-signs-you-need-a-dashboard-strategy/', 'Content': 'Dashboards consolidate and organize vast amounts of data.

Creating a heightened sense of excitement and anticipation, each pillar of this new tenet represents an advanced technology, but not so advanced that we are unable to identify with it. This is key—forward-thinking and modern but not too futuristic that it seems implausible or ridiculous.\\n\\n\\nEmbracing this avant-garde viewpoint, OEMs started calling themselves mobility companies rather than car manufacturers. Rideshare services via companies such as Uber and Lyft were exploding, \\ncar sharing\\n was taking off in selected areas, and new micro-mobility players—such as electric scooter rental companies Lime and Bird—were becoming household names in various cities (sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse). Innovative last-mile delivery solutions were actively being pursued to support the growth in e-commerce. And, at a commercial vehicle conference, I learned a new term—“curbside optimization”—about the management of space to accommodate the various needs of the curb and sidewalk in major metropolitan areas.\\n\\n\\nFast-Forward to Today—a World Blanketed by COVID-19\\n\\n\\nThe pandemic continues to adversely impact the majority of Americans with its one-two punch, having quickly spiraled out of control from a public health threat into an economic crisis with unprecedented levels of unemployment. Our way of life is in flux as we’re increasingly realizing we may be living with this threat for the indefinite future. Escalent has been conducting \\nresearch\\n to keep a close tab on how consumer behavior and sentiment continues to change alongside this quickly-evolving situation, and the insights we have uncovered help inform the path forward, for at least the near-term.\\n\\n\\nA majority (75%) of adults are not completely comfortable going into many public places, including a vehicle dealership, and people are least comfortable with taking public transit or using rideshare in fear of contracting the disease. Given the difficulty of “flattening the curve” in the US, there is heightened consumer focus on the cleaning and sanitizing protocols businesses are implementing to keep us safe. Americans are flocking to e-commerce, whether to buy essential items such as \\ngroceries\\n or to acquire a vehicle. We uncovered in our findings that consumers who intend to purchase a vehicle within the next 12 months want half of the purchase process to be online. Talk about a big shift for the future of mobility and dealers that are still in the midst of going digital due to the pandemic.\\n\\n\\nQuestion How the Future of Mobility Will Look Post-Pandemic\\n\\n\\nGiven this new consumer mindset and associated behaviors, how does C.A.S.E., or the future of mobility, look in a post-COVID-19 world?\\n\\n\\nDoes the “S” (Sharing/Subscription) in C.A.S.E. go away temporarily or permanently? Do we see a sustainable spike in consumers walking and biking for the first and last mile rather than using rideshare or micro-mobility? Do we see an acceleration or deceleration of electrification and autonomous development? Do we see an influx of first-time vehicle buyers?\\n\\n\\nWith three-quarters of people not completely comfortable using rideshare right now, how long this rideshare hiatus lasts will largely depend on how well companies such as Uber and Lyft regain the trust of their customers and employees. Similarly, micro-mobility companies will need to be diligent in identifying and executing new cleaning and sanitizing processes, at least in the near-term.\\n\\n\\nRegarding electrification and autonomous development, we don’t \\nforesee\\n electric vehicle (EV) players making a U-turn and permanently parking their plans for growing their market. However, given the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the supply chain and production, the penetration of electric vehicles, at least in the US, will likely stagnate. This may trigger a reprioritization of investment away from efforts dedicated to the improvement of EV technology and infrastructure, as least in the near-to-mid-terms. As future autonomous vehicles will likely be electric, this could have a ripple effect on investments earmarked for the development of advanced technologies designed for highly automated and autonomous vehicles. This could push the window for widespread adoption of AVs past the 10- to 20-year mark.\\n\\n\\nReassess Your Strategic Planning\\n\\n\\nThe future of mobility has always been about uncertainty and risk, and COVID-19 has amplified the challenges associated with managing these dynamics. The task at hand is to convert the uncertainty caused by the pandemic to a level of acceptable risk in order to move forward and continue innovating. The economy will not recover unless consumers spend money, and consumers won’t spend unless they feel safe. Therefore, it’s critical for industry players to seize the opportunity the pandemic has unexpectedly presented to critically rethink their strategies for the next generation of mobility.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, business leaders need to avoid falling into the trap of thinking that COVID-19 will only accelerate current mobility and demographic trends. What was believed to take place or evolve may no longer be the case. It is even more important now to understand the specific aspects consumers will value in this new environment and how this value system may change over time as the situation continues to evolve.\\n\\n\\nCOVID-19 may require us to follow a detour to reach our desired destination.

Is your utility prepared to support this massive change in how fleet customers use energy? Utilities that are prepared can reap rewards in their business and brand perception, while utilities that haven’t yet considered how to support fleet electrification risk being seen as obstacles by their fleet customers.\\n\\n\\nConsider a small housekeeping business with a 10-vehicle fleet. It is considering switching its fleet over to electric to save money but has questions about how EVs will fit into its business. Among these questions are charging time and infrastructure. Almost \\nhalf of fleet managers\\n recognize that adding EVs to their fleet will require changes to their business to accommodate EVs’ unique characteristics. Given that many fleet buyers have taken a measured approach to adoption—gathering information and piloting EVs in their fleets is crucial before committing to wholesale electrification.\\n\\n\\nAs they gather information, business customers like our housekeeping business can benefit from utility efforts like Portland General Electric’s \\neducation and consultation\\n to businesses considering EVs. As businesses move toward piloting EVs, programs like Georgia Power’s \\nWill It Work\\n can help fleet managers understand whether EVs are suitable for their fleet based on use and duty cycle data and start to plan for the changes their business will need to make to incorporate EVs.\\n\\n\\nOnce our housekeeping business has decided to invest in EVs for its fleet, it will need to install charging infrastructure and understand how to manage the EV fleet’s impact on the business’ electric use. Utilities can provide critical support here, too, as PG&E’s \\nEV Fleet\\n program does by providing turnkey infrastructure design, construction and maintenance.\\n\\n\\nPrior to transitioning its fleet to all-electric, our housekeeping business’ electric use and demand was similar to a residential customer’s. However, after electrifying its fleet, the business’ overnight demand spikes to nearly 80 kW and its overall use triples to 3,000 kWh a month. The business needs help understanding the implications of these changes on its bill, and may look for rate options like time-of-use that it wouldn’t have previously considered.\\n\\n\\nWhile every fleet customer’s situation will be different, the opportunity—as well as need—for utility programs to support fleet electrification is real. There are around 8.5 million cars and trucks in fleets around the country, which represents a significant opportunity for load growth as these vehicles are electrified. In addition to providing a significant new source of electric load growth, businesses that use EV charging programs from their utility are significantly more likely to say that their utility is a “partner in aiding the success of their business” than the average business.

Examples include advanced in-vehicle technology or futuristic design. Arguments range from making comparisons with Teslas that “have that feature” to thinking that an EV must showcase all of a company’s latest technology.\\n\\n\\nThis thinking is holding back broader EV adoption and here’s why.\\n\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\n\\nTaken as a whole, consumers most interested in EVs are twice as likely as all other buyers to care about in-vehicle technology, such as infotainment, displays, and connectivity. This group of EV intenders consists of three unique buyer types, only one of which has a keen interest in this type of technology. We discovered this thanks to Escalent’s \\nEVForward\\n, the largest, most comprehensive study of the next generation of EV buyers that we designed precisely to provide real, actionable answers. Identifying \\nsix EV buyer personas\\n, we learned the desire for advanced in-vehicle technology is the exclusive domain of Young Enthusiasts.\\n\\n\\nHowever, this changes when it comes to autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. Both Young Enthusiasts and Torchbearers are five times more likely to be interested in AV tech than the three personas with the lowest EV intent. Additionally, Stewards, despite their interest in EVs, may even be turned off by complex, cutting-edge AV features.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nComfort\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not just technology where one approach doesn’t fit all. Stewards—who share the same level of environmental interest as Torchbearers—have wildly different expectations for vehicle comfort. They are twice as likely to care about interior comfort and materials, so an EV must excel in these areas to attract Stewards (and make sure it’s an SUV while you’re at it!).\\n\\n\\nPrice\\n\\n\\nAnother common refrain is that to attract buyers in larger numbers, EVs must reach price parity with traditional gasoline vehicles—meaning the cost of an EV will have to be equal or less than a comparable gasoline vehicle. And yet, the top two EV buyer personas are three times more likely than other buyers to list price as the \\nleast\\n important attribute of their next vehicle. These buyers, who represent a substantial 22% of all vehicle buyers, are willing to pay for what they want—companies just need to deliver it. Hint: it’s not an expensive small car lacking many of the amenities they have come to expect in $40,000+ vehicles.\\n\\n\\nBattery Life\\n\\n\\nTesla has recently been in the news talking about the development of a “million mile” battery, which would help address the second biggest barrier to EV adoption, according to the 10,000+ buyers surveyed in EVForward. By and large, battery longevity has not been addressed. Doing so would dramatically improve EV interest. When offered a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty for the EV powertrain, the top three EV buyer personas increase their purchase consideration a staggering 20 points on a 0-100 point scale. In many cases, that’s the difference between simply considering an EV and having one in your driveway.\\n\\n\\nDiversify Your Strategies\\n\\n\\nThe old “one size fits all” approach to EVs hasn’t worked.

For auto finance, there are immediate impacts that need to be addressed now as well as longer-term changes which are speeding up long-discussed innovations.\\n\\n\\nThe most immediate impact has been the sudden and drastic decline in vehicle transactions. In addition to buyer’s loss of income to spend on big ticket items, buyers are just starting to trickle back into dealerships after they (and bank branches) were ordered closed by state governments. This has made financing in most parts of the country difficult, if not impossible. State restrictions easing and allowing dealerships to open is good news for auto finance as our research shows that those who were intending to buy or lease before COVID-19 are primarily postponing the transaction rather than canceling it entirely.\\n\\n\\nAs for longer-term impacts, the auto finance industry was already in a state of rapid change prior to COVID-19 and the pandemic has only accelerated the pace of that change. Auto finance companies have been actively looking to increase efficiencies by making various elements of the customer experience more digitized. Where in the past, some of these changes might have received push back from customers, the pandemic is making digital solutions more acceptable, and more expected, than ever. Buying and financing a car entirely online is suddenly not as remote an idea as it was only a short time ago.

In fact, I’ve often shared my concerns regarding the way EVs are marketed. Rather than focus on what makes EVs good\\n vehicles\\n, automakers have frequently resorted to sharing what makes EVs \\nless bad\\n than traditional gasoline vehicles—particularly from an environmental perspective. Such an approach is likely to score major points with early adopters and environmentalists but is certain to leave the broader consumer base—who we know will be slower to consider or buy into electrification—wondering why they should bother.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, people are naturally wary of “taking the plunge” to adopt new technology they’re not familiar with even in the best of times. That pitch becomes even more difficult for EV manufacturers during a global pandemic and recession. Within just a handful of weeks of the coronavirus reaching the United States, consumers had already begun seriously reevaluating their financial situations. Among the first line items up for review? Investments, vacations and… you guessed it: vehicle purchases. According to recent \\nEscalent research\\n, 55% of new vehicle buyers looking to purchase in the next year will delay their purchase—and those that still plan to buy expect to spend around $15,000 less.\\xa0With an overall reduction in demand for new cars comes an even more serious hit to the interest in EVs as uncertainty translates to dependence on safe, comfortable and familiar options.\\n\\n\\nAnother major hurdle facing EVs—and many other innovations in the automotive space—as a result of COVID-19 is the likely attrition and consolidation of startups developing these technologies. Economic uncertainty typically constrains funding as investors pull purse strings tighter and make “safe plays” to mitigate losses wherever possible. Many companies sinking unfathomable resources into developing these technologies are likely to face extremely tough choices in the coming weeks and months as those resources dry up. Such decisions could have long-term consequences for the advancement of EV technology and, as a result, broader adoption.\\n\\n\\nHowever, because COVID-19 will only exacerbate existing challenges to EV adoption, rather than introduce new ones, legislative bodies are unlikely to relax regulations driving automakers to develop EVs. This unyielding progress will ensure the technology eventually reaches a critical mass of adoption and becomes increasingly attractive to consumers who see and interact with EVs more frequently. The journey to adoption may look considerably different thanks to COVID-19, but so long as regulators stay their course, the outcome is likely the same.\\n\\n\\nTo learn more about our research on the impact of COVID-19 on the \\nautomotive and mobility\\n industry or to speak to one of our experts on how we can help you navigate this disruption, click the button below to send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 93, 'Heading': 'From Fatigued to Fully Functional: Four Tips for Video Conferencing', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/from-fatigued-to-fully-functional-four-tips-for-videoconferencing/', 'Content': 'Hangouts. Houseparty. Zoom. BlueJeans. Teams.\\n\\n\\nIn early February, these were likely unrelated words. Together today, they’ve taken on a whole new meaning. As we begin week 11 of the new normal, brought to us by COVID-19, it’s highly likely you’re among the throngs who have used some form of video conferencing. Whether for work, school or social connection, a record number of individuals have downloaded at least one of these programs over the past two months. I did the math in my own home, where I’m sheltering in place with my spouse and our three young children. Among us all, we average about 16 video conference calls a week.\\n\\n\\nWe’re EXHAUSTED. And I don’t think we’re alone.\\n\\n\\nAt first, video conferencing felt novel and exciting. There were team happy hours, Zoom book club meetings, Houseparty girls’ nights and group FaceTimes with family. But the frustrations quickly followed. In addition to the usual tech issues (internet outages, capped time on meetings, user-error on microphone and camera functions, headphone/device compatibility issues, etc.), I found it difficult to focus, particularly with my kids around. I missed pieces of conversation, and I couldn’t lean over to the colleague next to me to get a recap. I delivered reports but couldn’t read body language to gather whether my audience understood the information. I’d contribute to a conversation only to talk over a friend who was trying to do the same, resulting in the ever-awkward “no, you go—no, you go” exchange.\\n\\n\\nAccording to \\nPew Internet Research\\n, most of us are longing for the swift return of face-to-face interactions. Sixty-four percent of Americans agree that alternative communication formats help during these times but are no substitutes for in-person contact. But with many organizations recommending employees continue working remotely for the foreseeable future, video conferencing may be here to stay. So, how can we improve our circumstances in the here and now? Below, I offer a few evidence-based suggestions for how to use video conferencing to obtain the most benefit and reduce video conferencing fatigue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse Sparingly. \\nBefore scheduling a video conference, ask yourself: is the video component necessary? How will it enhance the meeting? Perhaps it doesn’t make much sense to have a video conference with a work group of 15+. Nor does it make much sense to use video if all eyes will be focused on the presenter’s PowerPoint slide. For a meeting chock-full of important details you need your team to absorb, would a phone call suffice? Or better yet, an email of those details that team members can reference later when they can give it their full attention?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGo for Brevity. \\nIf you believe video conferencing is the right choice, consider modifying the allotted time so that your audience, team and/or client has a moment after the call to refocus. For instance, schedule a 30-minute video call but end it after 25 minutes to allow a break for yourself and your team members before they move on to the next item on their to-do list or calendar, which could be—wait for it—another video conference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReduce Distractions. \\nTo ensure effective communication, eliminate as much “noise” as possible. In the communication field, we refer to noise not only as literal sound, but also as any external distraction that impedes our ability to listen. Prior to the video call, close internet tabs or instant messenger. On the actual video platform, consider turning off the self-view camera—so much of our mental fatigue is tied to how \\nwe\\n look! Speaking of backgrounds, simplify! Don’t get me wrong, I love my \\nStar Wars\\n-themed picture on Zoom as much as the next gal…but truthfully, busy backgrounds necessitate more mental processing by your audience. Select a background that is clean and free of distractions when possible. Help \\nothers \\nstay focused by eliminating background noise on your end: mute yourself until it’s your turn to speak (on some platforms, such as Zoom, while muted, you can hold down the space bar to temporarily unmute yourself to briefly speak).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrepare in Advance. \\nFor all the reasons above, participating on a video call can be challenging. The rules of turn-taking falter as we struggle more to read nonverbal cues signaling when someone else wants to speak. Some people (looking at you, introverts) may hesitate or be anxious to share on a video call. And the other half of your audience is likely multitasking anyways. How to beat the odds? Meeting owners should create an agenda that not only provides the meeting content, but that also signals who should (likely) speak on each point. It’s much easier to “pass the baton” directly rather than toss a content area out into the virtual abyss and see who picks it up. Another idea for less formal settings is to prepare two or three key questions you want everyone to answer, which the host then “moderates.” This ensures each participant gets a chance to respond. It may feel a little awkward or abnormal, but it’s better than missing out on someone’s important feedback. (And, let’s be honest, what about these times \\nis \\nnormal?)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you’re one of the many feeling the video conference burnout—hang in there. Try a few of these tips this week and see if your video conference fatigue abates just a little. And don’t forget these tips—video conferencing may be here to stay.\\n\\n\\nHave another great suggestion for video call success?

From India, where cities are getting the first views of the Himalayas they’ve had in decades, to Los Angeles, where photos of the city’s iconic skyline without smog have gone viral, to Atlanta, where meteorologists are sharing evidence of drastically lower air pollution, people can \\nsee\\n the difference not having tailpipe emissions makes. They can also \\nfeel\\n it with the better air quality making life significantly easier for people with chronic respiratory conditions.\\n\\n\\nThis is leading to increased consumer interest in EVs. Although new-vehicle sales have collapsed worldwide, there is \\nevidence from China, Europe and even the US\\n that electric models have weathered the storm better and are gaining market share.\\n\\n\\nSecond, historic job losses have put many consumers in a position where they may be unable to pay their utility bill—if not now, then in the coming months. While many utilities can recover these bad debts through a regulatory asset, the scope of the economic crisis means that this cost recovery is going to put a more significant upward pressure on rates than it has historically. Additionally, since many electric utilities rely heavily on natural gas generation, fuel costs will increase as supplies become constrained.\\n\\n\\nEVs give utilities a way to counterbalance this one-two punch of upward rate pressure. Utilities typically have a greater percentage of fixed costs than variable costs, so selling more energy to charge EVs allows utilities to spread those fixed costs over a larger base. According to Tim Jarrell, power supply VP for Cobb EMC, one of the largest co-ops in the country, “when we sell more energy due to EV charging, it benefits all customers because there are more kilowatt-hours to spread the fixed costs as we better utilize our power plant portfolio. The utility wins through lower distribution upgrades, less emissions, potential reduction in peak demand and greater revenue from on- and off-peak energy sales.”\\n\\n\\nThe caveat is that these benefits accrue only when the majority of charging is done off-peak, usually overnight. Darren Epps, electric transportation manager at Georgia Power, said, “our typical analyses are heavily reliant on the timing of charging, which is most economical when it happens at night.” However, Epps said that these analyses show that EV charging on Georgia Power’s system has marginal revenues that are greater than the marginal costs to serve, translating into downward pressure on rates over the long run.\\n\\n\\nEscalent recently conducted the largest national study on EV buyers to date, \\nEVForward\\n. The study yielded insight on consumer motivations and behaviors that can be applied to help increase adoption of EVs and utility EV programs. If you’re interested in learning how you can use these findings to accelerate your utility’s electric vehicle programs to lean in to these trends, please send me a note.'}\n","{'Index': 95, 'Heading': 'How Taiwan Is Successfully Fighting COVID-19 with Technology', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/how-taiwan-is-successfully-fighting-covid-19-with-technology/', 'Content': 'Taiwan. The island country has been praised for its successful fight against the virus. With a population close to 24 million, Taiwan has fewer than 500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and only 7 deaths as of early May 2020. Offices there have never been closed. Kids go to school as usual. Restaurants are open. What is Taiwan doing differently?\\n\\n\\nThe country’s success is the result of a myriad of factors, which include providing and encouraging the use of face masks, implementing an early travel ban, offering widespread viral and antibody tests, as well as making good use of information technology. As a researcher in our \\nTechnology\\n industry group, I particularly wanted to look at what and how technology has been employed by Taiwan in this pandemic. This is what I found.\\n\\n\\nUsing Big Data to Guide the Right Resources\\n\\n\\nLike residents of many Asian countries, people in Taiwan believe everyone should use face masks—arguably not for protecting the wearer, but for minimizing the risk of a sick person infecting others. With the help of technology, the Taiwan government has made an effort to ensure that everyone in Taiwan has masks.\\n\\n\\nAudrey Tang, a government minister of Taiwan—and a recent media celebrity in a couple of countries—was considered a genius (reported IQ score of 180) software developer before her service in the government. Under her leadership, the Taiwan government developed a resource planning and distribution system at lighting speed to ration surgical masks.\\n\\n\\nTo get an accurate picture of supply and demand, the system integrates Big Data about inventories for all pharmacies and supply chains in the territory, as well as population statistics and residential location data. The masks are then distributed to the appropriate parts of the country and residents are informed of where and how they can get masks using a mobile app. This system has prevented the chaos caused by mask shortages in places such as Hong Kong, where people queued up in the cold winter nights to buy masks at exorbitant prices. Additionally, Taiwan has rapidly increased its production capacity in factories, making sure the supply end can deliver. While much of the world is experiencing mask shortages, Taiwan has achieved a daily mask production of up to 10 million per day and has distributed them efficiently. Everyone has masks.\\n\\n\\nUsing Artificial Intelligence and Big Data to Track the Disease\\n\\n\\nThe use of Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI) has helped Taiwan effectively track potential COVID-19 cases and quarantined individuals. As individuals in Taiwan are asked to quarantine themselves at home for a certain period, multiple tactics ensure compliance. Taiwan is using mobile phone technology to monitor individuals to make sure they are not leaving home. Additionally, health authorities are using various databases such as travel records, transit records, credit card transactions and medical visit records to monitor individuals’ activities during quarantine.\\n\\n\\nSouth Korea is another example of how similar tracking technologies have helped reverse a dire situation. After the Daegu church incident, South Korea took a strong approach to contact tracing, which is tracked via people’s mobile phones.\\n\\n\\nThere is discussion worldwide on the privacy concerns associated with contact tracing—but original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that are enabling this tech are working on ways to keep consumer privacy intact as the app is downloaded and people begin to use it. \\nAccording to Apple and Google\\n, who are collaborating on a mobile tool that allows contact tracing, the data are rolled up at the geographic level to track the virus, and that it is not used on an individual level. While effective, this use of technology warrants a serious debate about the value of individual privacy and public health safety.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps a less intrusive method to tamp down the spread of the disease comes from Taiwan AI Labs, a privately funded research organization. In partnership with the government, Taiwan AI Labs developed and launched an app that allows users to see where crowds of people are present. In dense urban centers such as Taipei or Kaohsiung, the app is very useful, as it can warn users before they go to crowded locations where infection risk is higher.\\n\\n\\nSmart Use of Social Media Can Make a Difference\\n\\n\\nAccording to Audrey Tang\\n, one of the first successful tactics of Taiwan’s health authorities is the very fast reaction based on intelligence acquired via social media monitoring. Dr. Li Wenliang, the whistleblower who worked in a hospital in the epicenter of Wuhan, alerted a WeChat community about seven “alleged SARS infection cases” on December 30, 2019 (SARS was another coronavirus that erupted in China in 2003). Taiwan intercepted this information circulated via social media, reacted quickly and began health inspections for direct-flight passengers from Wuhan to Taiwan. That was as early as January 1, 2020.\\n\\n\\nTaiwan also uses social media as the primary tool to communicate information, educate the public and influence the social mood. Tang emphasized that during these stressful times, Taiwan has been employing humor to fight rumor. For instance, when a rumor about toilet paper shortage emerged, a government official responded lightheartedly in a speech to the public, “With one ass, how much toilet paper do you need?” Health guidelines were also provided lightheartedly. For example, publicity about the importance of social distancing was created using a \\ndog named Zongchai as a mascot\\n. Information about public health is taught, or advised, to people via Zongchai in a friendly and digestible way that has been circulated heavily on social media channels. As a result, Taiwan residents have more readily accepted, internalized and behaved according to government health guidelines compared with residents of other nations, according to Tang.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt Is About How Technology Is Used\\n\\n\\nAll the technologies I have discussed already exist and are fully established. Nothing new. But Taiwan has demonstrated innovative ways to effectively use Big Data, AI and social media to protect its people. The country has demonstrated how technology can be used with a timely and efficient response to more effectively fight this disease. Taiwan has also set an example of placing equal importance on science and humanities. When they communicate public health information, they care about the art of delivering messages to people who are beings with emotions. It is not just the science of sending data packets from a server to a smartphone.\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s Capabilities in Market Exploratory Research in APAC\\n\\n\\nEscalent is a top human behavior and analytics firm with experience in the technology, healthcare, financial services, automotive and consumer and retail markets of Asia-Pacific countries (APAC) including Taiwan.

And product manufacturers—hoping to stay relevant to choosy consumers—have embraced this ideal, seemingly offering infinite iterations, combinations, and configurations to capture mind and wallet share.\\n\\n\\nBut overwhelming choice has a flip side—it can lead to cognitive overload for consumers who, all too often, will block out the overly complex and rely on what they know. Professor and Author Barry Schwartz noted in his influential book, The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less, \\n“…as the number of choices keeps growing, negative aspects of having a multitude of options begin to appear. As the number of choices grows further, the negatives escalate until we become overloaded. At this point, choice no longer liberates, but debilitates.”\\n\\n\\nCustomization Comes at a Cost\\n\\n\\nCustomization comes at a cost, particularly in the automotive universe where the average option-laden vehicle has increased by an inflation-adjusted $5,000 to a $37,000 MSRP in 2019, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.\\n\\n\\nIn a \\nrecent interview with Automotive News\\n, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Hackett lamented increasing base prices and promoted a concept at Ford he calls “reductive design”—removing neglected or the least-desired options in cars (such as garage door openers and CD players, \\naccording to Hackett\\n) to help nudge down prices.\\n\\n\\nThis does not just apply to big ticket items, either. Choice and complexity were examined in a \\nstudy of jams\\n, and researchers noted \\n“consumers were more likely to buy when offered 6 jams (40%) instead of 24 jams (3%). Consumers also reported greater buying satisfaction.”\\n\\n\\nProper Focus Balances Content AND Differentiation\\n\\n\\nEscalent has partnered with auto manufacturers to \\nmanage complexity, simplify combinations, and optimize offerings\\n to maximize consumer satisfaction for 25 years. We developed a proprietary methodology—Strategic Optimization of Complex Offerings (\\nSOCO\\nTM\\n)—over two decades ago to reduce complexity in the automotive industry. Since then, we have applied this unique approach with clients across various industries, including \\nautomotive and mobility\\n, \\nconsumer goods and retail\\n, \\nhealth\\n, and \\ntechnology\\n.\\n\\n\\nDecades of research with mountains of economic and behavioral data around manufacturing and buying trends have verified two action steps that better align with clients’ need to protect market share, while focusing on consumer needs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOffer fewer options, and;\\n\\n\\nProvide a clearly differentiated choice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat does this type of complexity management look like, exactly?\\n\\n\\nLet’s look at Japanese manufacturers. Toyota has been extremely successful with a limited series line-up. Hyundai, Kia and Honda also have succeeded with a similar emphasis. On the other hand, some OEMs have offered five kinds of power seating on a single vehicle line—everything from two-way to 20-way adjustments. Product teams are hard pressed to articulate the advantages of each seating adjustment. Consumers, however, tend to focus on the main points of differentiation, such as whether the seating adjustment is manual or automatic.\\n\\n\\nDoes the consumer want blind spot monitoring, a blind spot information system, or blind spot cameras that pop up on a screen in the dashboard? It’s little wonder why consumers can be overwhelmed—and sometimes frustrated—by the complexity of options and unclear value propositions. And when consumers don’t understand what makes these features different from one another, they tend to overlook them and only see the “basic” one and the “best” one.\\n\\n\\nCommunicating Value Increases Acceptance\\n\\n\\nManufacturers resist adopting a less complex profile of product offerings for a variety of reasons, starting with—you guessed it—competition. As long as other companies offer options that are bigger, better, and more adjustable, an OEM feels like they must follow suit— too often, without even understanding whether consumers want the items at all.\\n\\n\\nSometimes, auto manufacturers have to offer new technology to remain in compliance with industry regulations but consumers might not understand why the technology was added or the value it provides. As such, it is all the more critical for OEMs to clearly communicate about features. This is especially important when new features have to be offered but are intimidating to consumers, such as mandated driving safety technology.\\n\\n\\nAutomakers often focus on reducing the number of free-standing options by bundling similar features, such as in cold climate, off-road or luxury packages. The goal is to provide consumers with all the features they want, none that they don’t want, and all this at an affordable price. Bundling makes it easier for consumers to evaluate which packages or level of trim will best meet their needs while enhancing their driving experience. However, bundling doesn’t replace the need for automakers to be able to clearly explain to consumers how features function and add value to the driving experience.\\n\\n\\nAs we have learned and other research has clearly shown, consumers can be more satisfied by having less choice. Manufacturers will be more successful if they offer product choices with clearly differentiated and easily explainable features for consumers to quickly understand which options provide them with the benefits they are seeking. Furthermore, we recommend manufacturers train new car buyers on how to use their vehicle’s features, which will help ensure consumers intimately understand their value.\\n\\n\\nEveryone Wins When Content is Optimized\\n\\n\\nMore features are not necessarily more desirable, nor more profitable. Building the right amount of complexity allows manufacturers to develop more efficient and compelling products. Proper research design can help de-content and optimize features for the benefit of both manufacturers and consumers.\\n\\n\\nIn the automotive industry, a vehicle can have billions of potential feature combinations. We use SOCO™ to guide the strategy to reduce this to the most optimal combinations, which can easily save millions of dollars. Furthermore, US consumers overwhelmingly buy vehicles off dealership lots. With our complexity management research, we guide our clients to ensure the right product is in the right place at the right time for the right buyer. Everyone wins!\\n\\n\\nThe automotive industry is far from alone in grappling with complexity management. We can streamline the portfolio offering for nearly any type of product with a price tag. Leveraging a specialized analysis honed over the years, we provide our clients with actionable recommendations to optimize their offerings, pricing, and product profitability—thereby improving customer satisfaction and ensuring brand consistency.\\n\\n\\nIf we can be of assistance to you in exploring the process of complexity management, please send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 98, 'Heading': 'Carpe Diem: The Argument for Doing Research Today', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/carpe-diem-the-argument-for-doing-research-today/', 'Content': 'You’ll be studying the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic for years to come.

According to a \\nstudy\\n conducted by Leasing Options from last year, automotive OEMs and tech companies such as Apple, Google and Samsung have dedicated billions to the development of self-driving vehicles. Volkswagen accounts for \\nover 50% of this investment\\n with $54.2 billion over a five-year period. Just recently, Waymo announced they \\nraised over $2 billion\\n in external funds after reaching significant milestones, such as driving more than 20 million miles on public roads across 25 cities and clocking over 10 billion miles driven in simulation.\\n\\n\\nDespite this influx of funding, forward progress and return on investment may be jeopardized as accidents continue to occur. In February, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered autonomous shuttle company \\nEasyMile to suspend service\\n after a Smart Columbus shuttle made a sudden stop that caused a women to fall from her seat.\\n\\n\\nTaking into consideration that the brightest minds across multiple disciplines are working together to redefine the future of mobility, I’m confident they will get the technology right to enable safe, reliable self-driving vehicles.\\n\\n\\nOf course, getting the technology right is only part of the equation—consumer acceptance is vital given the scope of investment. Our study highlights that most consumers are familiar with self-driving vehicles; 80% of respondents indicated they have seen or heard at least some information about SDVs. However, respondents’ opinions of self-driving vehicles are polarizing:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n39% have a “very/somewhat” negative opinion of self-driving vehicles compared to 32% who have a “very/somewhat” positive opinion.\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to using or riding in a self-driving vehicle, the ratio of people who are not open to using a self-driving vehicle to those who are open is 2:1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsumer adoption of self-driving vehicles may be less about the technical aspect and more about the psychological challenges associated with trust and risk. Increasing SDV market share will be largely dependent on how effectively makers of highly automated vehicles bridge the chasm between early adopters and the early majority. To do so, it is key for manufacturers to raise awareness of the benefits of self-driving vehicles and persuade consumers to trust the technology through thoughtfully designed educational curriculums that transparently address safety.\\n\\n\\nWhat do consumers think about all of this? Our study revealed that almost 50% of consumers think the manufacturer of the vehicle is best suited to educate the public. Following with a wide margin at 34% are third-party companies such as Consumer Reports, Kelley Blue Book and AAA. Manufacturers of self-driving software, hardware, cameras and sensors, dealerships and non-profits round out the third tier at approximately 25%.\\n\\n\\nGiven that the public is mostly familiar with self-driving vehicles and because the technology is intriguing, consumers are interested in learning more about SDVs. Their top five areas of interest include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSafety record/Test results\\n\\n\\nSafety of occupants\\n\\n\\nReliability/Dependability\\n\\n\\nOperation of the vehicle\\n\\n\\nSafety of pedestrians\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot surprisingly, the single most important area of learning for consumers is about self-driving vehicle safety records and test results. Educating consumers about the risk associated with using a self-driving vehicle is no easy task. Manufacturers need to make it crystal clear to the public that the benefits of the technology overwhelmingly outweigh the risks.\\n\\n\\nFor better or for worse, consumers are looking to OEMs for this story and I believe that, as in the past, OEMs will rise to the occasion. The leaders will be those who build trust early and define an education strategy that helps people get past the inherent psychological barriers associated with adopting an ever-evolving, yet-to-be-completely-perfected technology that is poised to redefine the future of mobility and what it means to be a vehicle driver.\\n\\n\\nEscalent is deeply embedded within the \\nautomotive and mobility industry\\n and keeps a close pulse on consumers’ changing attitudes and reactions to self-driving vehicles.

In fact, many smaller, less consequential decisions are often accompanied by thoughtful, purposeful processes to support, justify and prove the value each move will bring to the overall business.\\n\\n\\nToday, during the COVID-19 world pandemic crisis, we’re witnessing countless brands and organizations making quick-turn maneuvers to remain relevant, help their customers and ensure continuity of business. Brands have worked years, often decades or longer, building and nurturing relationships with their customers. So it’s natural for brands to feel a mutual connection with their customers and want to find a way through troubled times together.\\n\\n\\nYour Brand Will Be (Re)Made Now\\n, a recent Escalent blog by Lindsey Dickman, highlights how brands are being reshaped whether they take action or not, raising great points about why it’s important to control your own destiny by taking action now. But it’s not enough just to do something—in fact, it’s all too easy to damage your brand by taking the wrong action during a crisis. Motivated by the desire to “do something now,” many are performing without the usual safety net—ditching the tried-and-true processes that help make the difference between sticking the landing or falling from grace. Speed is important, but years of research and countless case studies have taught us that what you do must be thoughtful, sincere and authentic to avoid appearing opportunistic.\\n\\n\\nHere are some great examples of companies doing what they can to help.\\n\\n\\nDisney is a great example of a brand with such strong loyalty and brand love that they likely don’t \\nneed\\n to do anything, yet they did. To help make time at home with children a bit more bearable and fun for everyone, Disney released two titles on Disney+, their streaming subscription service, far ahead of schedule: Frozen 2 and Onward.\\n\\n\\nAmazon, Whole Foods and Target have increased wages and benefits to employees working the front lines and providing us access to the food and necessities we need. Other companies like Cisco and Apple have taken a step out of their usual tech-focused business lane to contribute directly to the medical cause, with big donations to support COVID-19 relief.\\n\\n\\nBut, recent history also has plenty of examples of brands stepping on their own toes.\\n\\n\\nRecently, a fashion brand fell victim to numerous missteps, starting with an email commiserating over the difficulties the world is facing—paired with a promotion on denim. Matters became more complicated when the fashion brand’s “100% human” brand ethos and “in this together” messaging coincided with layoffs in their customer experience group.\\n\\n\\nA colleague of ours was puzzled to find a note from a gas price monitoring company. It informed him that the CMO was working from home and that the company has renewed commitment to their core mission of providing accurate gas prices. While well-intentioned, the email just felt like clickbait, using the pandemic to get attention without bringing real value or new information to the customer.\\n\\n\\nBig decisions require big considerations.\\n\\n\\nBefore the pandemic, a brand would have been ill-advised to make a big decision without carefully vetting the impact it would have. The same holds true during and beyond the disruption caused by COVID-19. And it’s not just about good versus bad decisions. There’s an entire range of outcomes, and what’s good for one brand could spell disaster for another. It’s dangerous to spring blindly into action, even if competitors have already made moves. Just as we see limited medical resources being carefully rationed and distributed, brands, too, want to ensure their actions have the most positive impact.\\n\\n\\nNow more than ever, organizations need to evaluate the range of responses at their disposal to make the best decisions for their customers, their employees and for the betterment of the markets they serve. Luckily, this evaluation can be completed quickly. Rapid-deployment research, such as quick quantitative pulse checks, mobile surveys and discussions, existed long before COVID-19.\\n\\n\\nKey guidelines or gut checks brand marketers need to keep at the forefront of their minds include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBe efficient.\\n Which levers can I pull to make the most positive impact?\\n\\n\\nBe purposeful.\\n Which actions will result in short- or long-term lift?\\n\\n\\nBe real.\\n How can my brand show its genuinely good intentions and not come across as pandering?\\n\\n\\nBe what you are.\\n How can my brand remain consistent and true to its established identity?\\n\\n\\nBe where you should be.\\n What is appropriate for my brand to get involved in or speak out about?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is also crucial to work to avoid a few potential pitfalls during this time:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t be afraid to act.\\n Follow your gut (and these guidelines) to take quick action even in uncertain times.\\n\\n\\nDon’t force it.\\n Do what feels natural and authentic to your brand and your position in the market.\\n\\n\\nDon’t lose sight of your North star.\\n Stay true to your brand and overall mission.\\n\\n\\nDon’t forget to be human.\\n Remember that we’re all people. In times of crisis and uncertainty, people are what truly matter most.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrands that can keep pace with evolving customer needs and expectations, especially during times of crisis, can do so by following these guidelines and relying on scientific measures to land precisely where customers want and need them to be.\\n\\n\\nAre you trying to figure out which way to go next?

In the US, millions of families are experiencing a financial crisis due to the exceptional economic shutdown, loss of employment and looming signs of a recession. Given the chaos this pandemic is causing, to think there may be a silver lining seems almost ludicrous. But, in an unexpected and weird way, COVID-19 may actually be an accelerant to mobility innovation for the automotive industry.\\n\\n\\nImplication #1: Conditions Favor Acceleration of Expanded Connected Services\\n\\n\\nOver the last several years, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have been rolling out connected services—such as GM’s Marketplace—that blur the lines between car and home to deliver a digital experience that is an easy extension of what has become our “24/7 always on” life.\\n\\n\\nManufacturers have focused investment on developing connected car services to such an extent that the global connected car market was valued at $72.89 billion in 2017, and is \\nprojected to reach $219.21 billion by 2025\\n at a compound annual growth rate of 14.5%.\\n\\n\\nIn an effort to compensate for the decline in vehicle sales due to COVID-19, auto manufacturers may further fast track the expansion of their connected services and shift investment from highly automated vehicle technology to Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), which holds the promise of greater profitability.\\n\\n\\nIt will be another ten or more years before fully functioning self-driving vehicles become a reality on our roads—so automakers are looking at a longer timeline before they see a satisfying return on investment in developing highly automated vehicle technology. Conversely, manufacturers can reap greater benefits and profits in the near future by developing connected services that delight and compel consumers enough to pay for a subscription, which has not happened at a satisfactory level to date.\\n\\n\\nWe explore how automakers can own the connected car space and develop winning connected services that captivate consumers in a white paper that we will soon be publishing. \\nSign up for our newsletter\\n if you want to be one of the first to receive “Meet the Connected Car Concierge: How Automakers Can Delight Consumers & Win.”\\n\\n\\nImplication #2: Dealers Improve Digital Experience\\n\\n\\nCOVID-19 hit dealers hard. Some states did not categorize dealerships as an essential business, thereby forcing them to close their doors to prospective buyers. Many dealers, especially the smaller ones, were not optimized for digital vehicle shopping, acquisition and delivery. Whether it was due to “productive procrastination” where they knew they needed to modernize but chose to invest in other areas, or simply a lack of funds, many dealers were caught off-guard when states issued stay-at-home orders. In response, they pivoted quickly and “went digital” practically overnight to keep the doors open and preserve their financial health.\\n\\n\\nWith the fire drill of implementing a comprehensive digital vehicle acquisition process behind them, or nearly behind them, franchise dealers are now in a much better position to support OEMs as they expand their connected services—and, of course, to reap the financial rewards that appear to be so promising with connected services and MaaS.\\n\\n\\nImplication #3: Demand for Pre-Owned Vehicles is a Win-Win for Dealers and Buyers\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s \\nAutomotive & Mobility\\n team recently conducted a study to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 on consumers and the automotive industry. The findings revealed that 12-month vehicle intenders will employ several strategies to save money on their next vehicle. Many buyers are willing to compromise comfort and convenience, opting for smaller vehicles and less features to save money. Others will opt for a used vehicle to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership. As we trek toward the apex of the COVID-19 curve, the proportion of Americans who will select a used vehicle is likely to increase.\\n\\n\\nLate-model vehicles (under five years old) provide an \\naverage gross profit of $950\\n compared to $140 on a mass-market new car in 2019, according to J.D. Power. Buyers will not have to contend with limited inventory because \\n15.28 million late-model vehicles\\n will be available to cash-strapped buyers this year. In an unexpected way, both dealers and buyers walk away with a win.\\n\\n\\nOf course, the wild card is consumer adoption of new mobility solutions and the new role personal vehicle ownership will play. Time will tell whether the future of transportation looks more like subscription-based car sharing made available through all dealerships (rather than a few), or cloud-based, on-demand, highly automated vehicles consumers summon from their smartphone.\\n\\n\\nUntil then, let’s hope we see a light at the end of the tunnel soon and look forward to tomorrow.\\n\\n\\nEscalent will continue to follow the American perspective, how it may impact purchase behavior, and the effects on the automotive and mobility industry as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve.

However, sometimes, despite frantic juggling, rearranging and trying to warp the space-time continuum, there are times when schedules simply don’t align and we have to give a client news they don’t want to hear: Their favorite moderator is not available to facilitate their project.\\n\\n\\nYou might be surprised to know that it can be just as hard for the moderator to say they can’t make it work as it is for clients to hear moderators say it. But when I set aside my disappointment in these situations, I can see a number of silver linings.\\n\\n\\nA Fresh Set of Eyes\\n\\n\\nA new moderator with a fresh perspective may offer a prime opportunity to relieve potential bias and create space for unexpected findings. As moderators, we try very hard to stay impartial, but we’re only human. When you’ve conducted many studies for the same disease state for the same client, it can be challenging to keep bias at bay.\\n\\n\\nTwo Heads Are Better Than One\\n\\n\\nOf course, no one wants to lose out on the ability to build new insights upon the old—but that just offers a great opportunity to collaborate. Escalent’s dedicated team of moderators often work together to support our clients, allowing us to layer in creative thinking from a new team member working together with a moderator who has extensive expertise in the space. This is particularly helpful for studies where clients want to dig deeper into previously explored territory. A “new-to-you” moderator can help you see new patterns, while your favorite moderator can ensure that old insights aren’t rehashed. Remember: Your favorite moderator may not be available to conduct the interviews, but that doesn’t mean he or she can’t be involved in the analysis to ensure that only truly novel insights are brought to the team.\\n\\n\\nAdding Facets to Your Current Perspective\\n\\n\\nBringing in a moderator who has experience outside of the category can allow clients the opportunity to consider new perspectives. While a “new-to-you” moderator, of course, needs to have the background and knowledge to “talk the talk” of the industry, having experience in other categories can bring a fresh outlook. Sometimes it is easier to see the parallels (like a moderator who specializes in pharmaceuticals working in the OTC or health insurer space) than others. But it helps to keep in mind that at the very core, all respondents we speak to are consumers who make decisions based on underlying attitudes and perceptions—whether they are doctors and patients in the \\nhealth\\n and pharmaceutical space, advisors in the \\nfinancial\\n space or IT decision-makers in the \\ntech\\n space. Taking a break from the “norm” allows moderators to broaden their knowledge base, and can also help preempt moderator burn-out (this is especially relevant in the pharmaceutical space, which can have very emotional interactions).\\n\\n\\nOpportunity for New Approaches\\n\\n\\nEvery moderator has their own style and own way of tackling questions—and while you might be very comfortable with the way your favorite moderator does things, working with a new moderator offers the chance to see and hear things differently. The temporary absence of your favorite moderator can allow the introduction of new approaches—whether it is a new technique or simply a new way of asking an old question. Any good moderator (and I am sure your favorite moderator is a good one) is happy to incorporate things that work into your next study.\\n\\n\\nTaking the Leap with a New Moderator\\n\\n\\nThere can be a lot of value in considering a new moderator, and the \\nqualitative\\n team at Escalent has several ways to help clients become comfortable with a new team member.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPilot interviews are a great opportunity to build confidence with a new moderator. Often, we’ll have your favorite moderator conduct initial interviews while the “new-to-you” moderator observes and gets up to speed—and then we can switch off. This allows the new team member an opportunity to get feedback from both the client and the legacy moderator familiar with the previous research.\\n\\n\\nWorking as a team through both interviews and analysis with two moderators offers clients a way to ease into the transition and reap the benefits of collaboration.\\n\\n\\nHaving the new moderator conduct the interviews and team up with the legacy moderator during setup and analysis can ensure that no continuity is “lost” in the transition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy ensuring that our clients become comfortable with moderators who are new to them, we hope that we can offer multiple trusted moderators to help serve our clients’ research needs.\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s moderators are the best in the business.

The participants ranked the following in order of favorability and likelihood to invest in more over the next six months: Data Analytics, Battery Electric Vehicles, Telematics, and Autonomous Vehicles.\\n\\n\\nThe timeline for non-adopters to implement these tools and technologies ranges from three to five years.\\n\\n\\nThere is significant opportunity with one-third of fleet leaders who envision adopting electric trucks within the next twelve to twenty-four months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElectric trucks are coming, quickly, and commercial fleet businesses must accept it \\nnow \\nif you have not already. However, regardless of your company’s current position on adopting electric trucks, electrifying fleets is going to change how commercial fleet business is done. Even if your commercial fleet has not implemented or adopted any electrification changes to date, you will be affected by the impacts to the larger industry, which includes the overall fleet supply chain. It is critical to the success of all companies to start preparing \\ntoday\\n for the impact of electrification on the fleet ecosystem and all future implications this will have on your business. To help you with this, here are five practical considerations for you to start addressing today.\\n\\n\\nFive Key Considerations for Fleet Electrification that Businesses Need to Start Addressing NOW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlan for Process Changes\\n: Electric vehicles are not a one-for-one proposition; they don’t directly replace internal combustion trucks. Fleets need to consider process changes along with updates to vendor and customer interactions as you on-board electric trucks.\\n\\n\\nConsider the Impacts to Your Entire Business\\n: Electrification changes how organizations operate and how they do business. Range, load size, route efficiency, opportunity to charge, amount of time on the road, truck time utilization, and charging schedules will influence the entire supply chain, and impact fleet adoption and implementation.\\n\\n\\nIncrease Collaboration within your Supply Chain\\n: As electrification of fleets expands, it will be increasingly important to cooperate and collaborate with others in the supply chain to address and solve the impacts of electrifying part or all of your fleets.\\n\\n\\nFocus on Optimization\\n: Traditional scheduling and timing will change as fleet electrification grows, which makes supply chain optimization even more valuable.\\n\\n\\nUse Data to your Advantage\\n: The utilization of data and analytics, including telematics information and other sources, is even more important as fleets electrify. It will be critical to long-term success to understand and implement programs that use this data to monitor and improve electric vehicle performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImpacts for Manufacturers & Service Providers of Commercial Fleet\\n\\n\\nIn this age of ever-increasing need for commercial fleet vehicle businesses to integrate new tools and technologies, manufacturers and service providers need to empathize and partner with their fleet customers to intimately understand and overcome the significant challenges their customers face. This will allow manufacturers and service providers to iterate quickly and continue to provide best-in-class products and services to their fleet customers.\\n\\n\\nWe are always interested to learn more and believe that you—the reader—have a unique perspective to add to the dialogue. \\nFeel free to send us a note directly to talk further about the incredible nuances of the commercial fleet industry or the findings from our FTI study.'}\n","{'Index': 106, 'Heading': 'How to Manage Your Market Research Wisely in a Time of Crisis', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/how-to-manage-your-market-research-wisely-in-a-time-of-crisis/', 'Content': 'We are in the midst of the most significant health crisis most of us have ever seen. Every day holds a new challenge, and the news is continually reporting something that previously would have seemed out of the realm of possibility—such as canceling March Madness or shutting down Las Vegas. What does all this mean for your business? How do you continue to move forward with your marketing and market research? And, could the current state of mind impact the value of the insights you get?\\n\\n\\nThe answer, as you might have guessed, requires thoughtful consideration. \\n\\n\\nThe economic and business environment is changing rapidly. Major decisions will continue to be made, and they will have long-ranging impacts. A misstep in action or tone will have outsized consequences with nervous customers. In addition to immediate decisions, preparation for what comes next is critical.\\n\\n\\nIt is important to have good data to make good decisions. The key is to ensure you can get that data along with the context and consultation needed to rapidly put them into action. There are some cases where it may make sense to revisit your market research plan, for instance if your research is with respondents on the frontline of the crisis (i.e., state officials, certain physician specialties, hospital administrators). On the other hand, hitting the pause button on must-have key strategic work for new product development or a tracker could mean losing critical business insights.\\n\\n\\nHere are a few questions that you can ask to help you make the right decision:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat am I trying to discover?\\n The answer to this question will lead the way. While this is a temporary crisis, it could change people’s behavior and attitudes in the long term. Consider not only what you want to learn today, but what you’ll need to know tomorrow.\\n\\n\\nCould I learn something by asking about the crisis directly? \\nIt sounds simple, but you could gain insight by asking if the crisis has influenced how respondents answered your survey, and it could provide guidance into how to interpret your results.\\n\\n\\nWhat could I learn from revisiting past research?\\n It is amazing what our team can discover from revisiting existing data and studies. We can cut data in a different way or delve into existing transcripts and videos to find new insights. It is worth asking.\\n\\n\\nIs there value in connecting with people other than in person? \\nFace-to-face interviews are a great way to engage with respondents, but there are \\nmany virtual and online options\\n that provide as good—and sometimes even better—insights while still supporting social distancing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConcerned about data quality?\\n\\n\\nEscalent has been monitoring all projects before and after March 11, when the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to make sure we have a clear understanding of whether or how this crisis is impacting response rates. Overall, we are not seeing a lot of change, but here are some specifics on what we are seeing from the field:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmail-to-web surveys\\n continue to survey well and response rates are comparable to pre-March 11 rates.\\n\\n\\nConsumer telephone survey \\nresponse rates have improved. We attribute this to more people being at home while practicing social distancing.\\n\\n\\nBusiness telephone survey\\n responses have shown mixed results. We expect business research by phone to be the most susceptible to a significant drop in productivity. We are monitoring this closely to quickly identify performance issues, and will pause dialing, if necessary, to assess our options if certain projects experience significant fielding challenges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe will continue to monitor customer sentiment, research productivity, and potential changes in results on a daily basis, and we will advise our clients immediately if we recommend taking action.\\n\\n\\nEscalent recognizes the significance of the COVID-19 disruption.

Where is the new news? Where are the enhanced connected car experiences or capabilities that begin to deliver the level of disruptive and transformative benefits that my smartphone already gives me?\\n\\n\\nEquipped with connected car technology, I see my vehicle as a smartphone with a wheel on each corner—it knows where I am, where I am going and, most likely, the purpose of the journey.\\n\\n\\nIf vehicle manufacturers were to re-interpret the role of a vehicle beyond that of a transit device and more in line with the emotional and practical support that my car delivers to me in various scenarios, then I might be more inclined to subscribe to some services that would meet the manufacturer’s objectives to successfully monetize\\xa0connected car technology.\\n\\n\\nThat is not the case today but let’s explore this possibility a little and the boundaries that could exist to where I give my connected car permission to play or not.\\n\\n\\nScenario #1: How a Connected Car Could Have Enhanced my Car Shopping Experience\\n\\n\\nLet’s rewind the clock and imagine that my old connected car had had the capability to realize that I was visiting car dealerships one Saturday afternoon. If my connected car could have then realized that there was a reasonable chance I was looking for a new car, what could it have offered me?\\n\\n\\nImagine that, all of a sudden, a message from a finance company pops up on my car’s screen offering competitively priced loans. My reaction could have been: “How dare you!” On the other hand, another person might value that kind of information and find it very useful while car shopping.\\n\\n\\nIf the car could have been able to recognize that I had been doing the legwork around the dealerships all afternoon and might be a bit frazzled, it could alert me to the fact that there is an artisan coffee shop two minutes away and, as an owner of this brand of car, I could get a 20% discount. My reaction would have been: “What a great idea to relax and digest all the information I’ve gathered.”\\xa0 Another person might view this as a cynical “ad break” and resent the disruption.\\n\\n\\nScenario #2: How a Connected Car Could Improve my Weekend Getaway\\n\\n\\nNow, let’s imagine future possibilities with my new connected car, such as when my wife and I are taking a weekend trip to a coastal resort that we have never been to before.\\n\\n\\nPicture this: one hour into the trip, my new connected car displays a series of hotel accommodation offers. My reaction would be “too little, too late.”\\xa0 A different person, having thought of the trip on the spur of the moment, might value the suggestions.\\n\\n\\nThen, after two hours of driving, my connected car informs me that, with a detour of 10 minutes, we would be able to experience a picturesque heritage site that also has a coffee shop and plenty of parking. I would think that this “sounds like a great idea.” Another person might appreciate the thought but would rather get on to their destination.\\n\\n\\nTwo Key Takeaways for Connected Car Manufacturers\\n\\n\\nThese simplistic scenarios and hypothetical reactions are meant to highlight two key principles for connected car makers:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf vehicle manufacturers want to monetize connected car technology, they need to think outside of the box and consider exploring new digital terrains that far expand the nature and range of support they could offer vehicle owners.\\n\\n\\nDifferent types of vehicle owners will have different feelings about giving vehicle manufacturers permission to play in various digital and informational terrains—sometimes, it will be because there are better, more trusted providers of such services and, other times, it will be because vehicle manufacturers are not perceived to be credible facilitators of those services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur team has a great deal of experience in this arena as we are constantly deepening our knowledge and capabilities while working with a broad range of automakers.

Who Will Build It?', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/charging-infrastructure-could-make-or-break-the-bev-market-who-will-build-it/', 'Content': 'Imagine driving to work in your battery electric vehicle (BEV)—also known as EVs. You enter a public parking lot, pull into the space of your choice, and press a button on your smartphone app to request a charge. While you’re away, a mobile charging robot rolls to your car, opens the charging socket flap, connects a battery wagon to provide a charge, and then disconnects and removes the wagon, all before you return.\\n\\n\\nA prototype developed by Volkswagen, the \\nself-driving charging robot\\n is just one possible solution to overcoming what consumers say is their biggest barrier to BEV adoption: charging infrastructure.\\n\\n\\nOur latest proprietary research on \\nthe future of BEVs\\n shows that 74% of US consumers believe that charging infrastructure needs improvement. European consumers also see room for improvement, as only 28% believe it’s easy to charge at home, while even fewer (16%) believe it’s easy to charge at work. And as more electric vehicles take to the streets, the need for infrastructure—and its associated costs—will grow. According to the National Council on Clean Transportation (NCCT), the US will need to invest \\nmore than $2.2 billion in BEV charging infrastructure\\n across 100 of its most populated metropolitan areas by 2025 to cover the expected increase in electric vehicle adoption.\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, BEV adoption rests on the ability to access electricity and charging stations whenever and wherever drivers need them. And while consumers expect governments, automakers and even fuel providers to help build the charging infrastructure, there is no grand plan or working policies in place.\\n\\n\\nSo, the world is left wondering: Who will pay for and build the BEV charging infrastructure necessary to keep the wheels of electric vehicles rolling? \\n\\n\\nPeople have long engaged in the debate over infrastructure as an enabler of innovation, steering the conversation toward government funding and subsidies or tax incentives. One of the most prominent examples of government-funded infrastructure that paved the way for innovation is the internet. Backed by US Department of Defense funding and tax subsidies, the government contracted with private companies to help build the backbone of today’s internet economy. What if the federal government threw billions into infrastructure like it did for the internet? Would it jump-start the private sector into investing more into building out BEV infrastructure, thus driving up BEV sales? Right now, there are lots of industries that are playing a role, but is any one of them more effective than the other?\\n\\n\\nAccording to our research, US consumers believe carmakers are primarily responsible for building BEV infrastructure at home, while fuel companies, local and national government should build public infrastructure. European consumers, on the other hand, say national government should provide funding for public infrastructure, followed by carmakers and local governments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernment\\n\\n\\nCurrently, the federal government hasn’t indicated it will invest in building BEV charging infrastructure directly, but it does provide tax benefits to private companies building the infrastructure, such as charging network providers. However, these benefits don’t appear to be driving purchase or infrastructure build-out.\\n\\n\\nStates and municipalities have already begun engaging in infrastructure ventures. According to the \\nCenter for American Progress\\n, 17 states provide financial incentives that lower the costs for installers of BEV chargers. Washington state, for example, offers tax exemption for the installation of chargers, while New York state has committed to provide $250 million for charging infrastructure through the year 2025.\\n\\n\\nOne aspect to consider with government funding is whether the service being considered is a public good. When it comes to climate change and environmental concerns, the answer to that question depends on whom you’re talking to. \\nGallup research\\n shows that 70% of Americans age 18–24 are worried about global warming, while only 62% of those age 35–54 and 56% age 55 and older believe the same. Based on the apparent divide between generations, younger generations might believe that electric charging infrastructure is a public good and should be funded by governments, while older generations might think it’s a luxury good and prefer that governments fund something else like healthcare or road infrastructure.\\n\\n\\nUtilities\\n\\n\\nUtilities in many states have already pledged to increase electric charging stations in their territories, as well as offer rebates to consumers for installing new chargers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPacific Gas and Electric Company\\n announced it would install 7,500 EV chargers at workplaces and apartment buildings across Northern California, in addition to the 21,000 stations already used in the state.\\n\\n\\nGeorgia Power\\n has installed public charging stations across the state and offers rebates to customers who install home charging stations.\\n\\n\\nKansas City Power and Light\\n has installed more than 1,100 public\\xa0EV\\xa0charging stations in its service territory, with plans to continue expanding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether regulators will converge on a national consensus about putting infrastructure investments into utility rate bases or will expect infrastructure investments to stand on their own as unregulated programs. Utilities should also consider that the \\nincreased demand for rapid charging may create burdens on the electrical grid\\n and will require a greater understanding of BEV drivers’ patterns and habits than ever before.\\n\\n\\nAuto Manufacturers\\n\\n\\nAutomakers around the world are working to meet the infrastructure challenge—even collaborating with each other to make a bigger impact. Volkswagen’s Electrify America, funded by the automaker’s 2016 diesel emissions settlement, has committed to investing $2 billion over 10 years in BEV infrastructure, access and education programs across the US. The company reported that it has built \\n400 stations\\n in fewer than two years.\\n\\n\\nTesla has invested in charging stations across the world to support its BEVs, as well as partnered with charging station providers to install Tesla chargers in their facilities. The company reports that it has more than 1,800 charging stations worldwide.\\n\\n\\nIn the UK, six car manufacturers have teamed up to create \\nIONITY\\n, a high-power charging network that currently has more than 400 charging stations along major highways in Europe. A joint venture between BMW Group, Daimler, Ford, Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche, IONITY has partnered with businesses like Shell and Circle K to house its charging stations.\\n\\n\\nFueling Stations\\n\\n\\nAs a growing number of BEV and hybrid vehicles take to the road, there will be less need for traditional gas stations. Fueling stations will need to pivot their business model to accommodate this change unless they want to cede territory to another entrant, such as new companies, local utilities or even governments, that will provide charging services.\\n\\n\\nCompanies such as \\nRoyal Dutch Shell and BP\\n have already begun building charging infrastructure. Shell has been implementing its Shell Recharge BEV charging service in sites across Europe since 2017. In November 2019, the company installed its first EV charging station in the United States in Boston Logan International Airport, made possible through an acquisition of Greenlots, a Los Angeles-based provider of BEV charging software and solutions.\\n\\n\\nBP is investing in both electric vehicle charging companies and battery technology firms in the UK and China to expand BEV charging infrastructure. Its charging company, \\nBP Chargemaster\\n, has already installed 7,000 charging points across the UK and is now working to create a nationwide network of ultrafast chargers to increase BEV adoption and help ease consumer concerns around long charging times. BP launched its first 150kW ultrafast BEV charger on one of its BP Retail sites near Heathrow Airport, and plans to roll out 400 more in the UK by 2021.\\n\\n\\nThe Future of BEV Infrastructure Is Anyone’s Game\\n\\n\\nThe future of BEVs and charging infrastructure is up in the air. Not only that, but because current infrastructure is being built piecemeal and incrementally, there is no center of gravity for the build-out.\\n\\n\\nAs with the internet, figuring out where the funding for BEV charging infrastructure comes from and how it’s built out will take time. Further, the “good” derived from investing in this sort of infrastructure is somewhat unknown. Will it lead to some sort of disruption on the highway roadside fueling economy? Will it require a massive reconfiguration of utility services that then sparks another unforeseen disruptive technology?\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to know more about how your business can thrive in this emerging landscape, we can help.

Consumers know they are coming. However, high prices and limited choices continue to feed the counter-BEV movement. Coupled with a non-ideal charging infrastructure and significant doubt about the journey range of current BEV choices, many consumers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.\\n\\n\\nHowever, the \\nrecent news\\n that Tesla—the world’s leader in BEV manufacturing—will ship 500,000 models across the globe in 2020 confirms that there is a company getting BEVs “right” for a growing number of BEV buyers worldwide.\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s \\nAutomotive & Mobility\\n team recently conducted a global study to explore how manufacturers can make BEVs exciting—thereby spurring greater rates of adoption—and which companies consumers trust to make the best BEVs. Here’s what we found.\\n\\n\\nWhat Will Motivate European Consumers to Buy BEVs?\\n\\n\\nOur study shows that European consumers are more willing to buy a BEV today (13% of vehicle purchasers) versus US consumers (4%). However, European vehicle buyers appear to be grudging participants in the transaction, viewing BEVs as inevitable rather than inviting due to an expectation that governments will artificially induce the BEV-buying market with use restrictions, taxation and financial incentives.\\n\\n\\nFindings also reveal that, predictably, car buyers age 55 and older are the group least likely to make the jump today, preferring to wait until BEVs meet their standards rather than sacrificing comforts to which these car buyers feel they have become accustomed. These buyers will also likely adopt BEVs when they feel pricing is more equivalent with that of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles—and when they are sure they can use the vehicle without facing additional inconveniences.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, buyers younger than 35 are less inclined to recognize what those age 55-plus see as issues. The younger group more readily acknowledges the existence of altruistic benefits, such as environmental protections, and seems to be more willingness to make what they feel is a socially conscious choice—even if it means they must adapt traditional behavior to a BEV lifestyle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Types of BEV Companies Will European Consumers Trust?\\n\\n\\nThere is a healthy contingent of European consumers who simply don’t believe that incumbent ICE vehicle manufacturers are the obvious choice to bring the BEV promise to reality. According to our survey, these consumers feel that BEV leadership is a virtual draw between legacy carmakers and newer EV specialist brands. This should serve as a warning to traditional vehicle manufacturers: their reputation alone won’t be enough to encourage consumers’ transition to electric vehicles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the factors causing this uncertainty?\\n\\n\\nSome consumers’ doubts about the reliability of legacy car brands contribute to the sense of risk they feel about BEVs. This means that consumers don’t necessarily consider traditional car brands to be the natural go-to specialists of new-wave cars.\\n\\n\\nTraditional car brands have never been able to completely rely on the unconditional trust of their customers. This is even a factor for older drivers who have had a longer relationship with traditional brands and, thus, dealt with more broken promises than their younger counterparts.\\n\\n\\nThose younger than 35 feel confident that newer, specialist BEV brands have the flexibility to produce true, forward-thinking designs and technology.\\n\\n\\nWhat Does This Mean for BEV Makers?\\n\\n\\nSo, who will ultimately win the hearts, minds—and wallets—of the BEV-buying public? How will the winners do so? And what is the responsibility of private industry, public interest groups and governments to facilitate a bright BEV future?\\n\\n\\nIn \\nThe Future of BEV: How to Capture the Hearts and Minds of Consumers\\n, we address these questions—and draw more insights—using the innovation adoption litmus test, an approach used in tech to evaluate new products. This test looks at five key factors to help companies identify areas of strength, opportunity and likelihood of adoption, which we apply to BEVs.\\n\\n\\nTo read The Future of BEV: How to Capture the Hearts and Minds of Consumers, click the button below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethodology: We reference data from an Escalent study involving a sample of 1,012 consumers from Germany, Spain and the UK aged 18 and older interviewed from June 25 to July 9, 2019.\\xa0Respondents were recruited from the Full Circle opt-in online panel of European adults and interviewed online.\\xa0The data were weighted by age, gender and census to match the demographics of the German, Spain and UK populations.\\xa0Due to their opt-in nature, these online panels (like most others) do not yield a random probability sample of the target population.\\xa0As such, it is not possible to compute a margin of error or to statistically quantify the accuracy of projections.

It’s About the Tech.', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/bevs-its-not-about-the-car-its-about-the-tech/', 'Content': 'Technology is so tightly woven into the fabric of our lives, most times it’s hard to remember how we ever lived without it. At home, you can turn on your TV, spin up a movie, order groceries and schedule a bank transfer with a simple voice command. Use your smartphone to enter a convenience store, choose your products and be on your way without passing through a checkout. Or, take a virtual reality (VR) trip across the world from the comfort your living room.\\n\\n\\nFrom healthcare and travel to entertainment and education, technology has transformed entire industries by introducing efficiencies, innovation, new business models and novel customer experiences. And it’s changed our relationship with just about everything—including the cars we drive. The latest \\ntechnology\\n advances help us stay safer, monitor maintenance issues, and make driving more enjoyable.\\n\\n\\nAs \\nauto and mobility\\n manufacturers have struggled to sell battery electric vehicles (BEVs)—also known as EVs—it may be in part because they’re too tied to the traditional utility of the car rather than how this new technology can improve consumer lives in more meaningful ways.\\n\\n\\nThe convergence of tech and car culture is a golden opportunity to change consumer perceptions about BEVs. Going beyond environmental benefits, conversations that focus on cutting-edge technology, driver convenience, lower cost of ownership and just plain fun have the potential to move the BEV needle and propel growth in ways we’ve not yet seen.\\n\\n\\nOnce automakers can change the conversation and reposition their cars in the eyes of the consumer, the BEV market has the potential to finally crank into high gear.\\n\\n\\nThe Cool Factor\\n\\n\\nBefore the proliferation of technology, car enthusiasts and tech fans seemed to gravitate toward very different things. While one group valued power trains and fuel injections, the other prized gadgets and the latest software or hardware releases. Sure, both tinkered with “technology,” but they would never be considered cut from the same cloth.\\n\\n\\nToday, that distinction is being blurred, and it’s something automakers should pay attention to. The mass market for cars is highly commoditized with small things used to differentiate, but for the “car enthusiast” persona, there’s still a market of classic cars and premium cars out there. By adding new and sophisticated tech—such as electric propulsion, radar cruise and torque braking—automakers can separate the commoditized middle and the high-end car persona with a new segment: the tech-car enthusiast.\\n\\n\\nBecause, when it comes to buying a car, it’s really not about the car. It’s about the technology. How it looks, feels and makes you feel.\\n\\n\\nCase in point: Tesla. Maker of the best-selling BEVs in the world, the Tesla name has become synonymous with electric cars—and cool! Recently, its 2019 Tesla Model 3 has been named the \\ntop-rated electric car for 2020\\n by Edmunds.com, and \\ndrivers in Norway\\n named the Model 3 as their favorite car for 2020—over other BEVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to their cars, Tesla’s key to success lies in the way they’ve positioned those cars to consumers. The BEV leader has worked to \\nbuild a lifestyle brand\\n rather than an electric car, appealing to consumer desire for style, luxury and the latest technology.\\n\\n\\nAccording to our research, 47% of European consumers say that “cool technology” gives BEVs an advantage over ICE vehicles. With a large touchscreen tablet console, the ability to stream content like Netflix and Spotify, \\nsmart sensors\\n to monitor potential damage to your car (like keying) and self-driving capabilities, owning a Tesla is much like having the latest trendy tech gadget.\\n\\n\\nAn \\nLA Times\\n article even suggests that having an electric car isn’t all that important to Tesla buyers: “Some analysts think buyers don’t necessarily want an electric car when they buy a Tesla—they primarily want a Tesla, which has replaced the latest iPhone as the coolest accoutrement in Silicon Valley and similar cultural enclaves around the world.”\\n\\n\\nTesla has built its brand and following around the merits of its technology and consumer preferences, and it’s a strategy worth replicating. Other BEV makers, from Nissan to Audi, have followed suit, incorporating technologies like wireless charging, voice recognition, the ability to find your car remotely, smart cameras, and automatic seating and climate control adjustments based on the recognized driver.\\n\\n\\nEnjoying the Ride\\n\\n\\nOne of the things that is not talked about much is \\nhow fun BEVs are to drive\\n. When you step on the gas, they immediately go—they are “\\nexcitingly responsive\\n.” The cabin is so quiet, it’s been described as an “\\noasis of calm\\n.” And because BEVs hug the road more tightly than internal combustion engine vehicles, some say BEVs are as fun to drive as a go-cart.\\n\\n\\nImportantly, our research shows that consumers consider a quiet, smooth ride one of the top advantages BEVs have over ICE vehicles. Here are some other functional and emotional benefits that are not often discussed or used in the sales process:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s Like a Game:\\n One writer describes how \\ndriving an BEV feels like a game\\n: “You can’t drive a certain way and bring in more fuel in an internal-combustion engine vehicle; your fuel gauge only goes one direction: down … But driving an EV, I was hooked—driving could essentially become a game, saving me money and energy as the battery recharged when I slowed down or naturally sped up heading down a hill.” Similarly, there are likely some drivers who get pleasure out of gamifying where they’ll charge up when taking their BEV on a long trip.\\n\\n\\nSay “Goodbye Maintenance”:\\n Imagine the thrill of knowing that you’ll never have to take your car in for an oil change again. (And you can secretly gloat as you see your neighbor pull into Jiffy Lube.) As BEV technology replaces many of the moving parts characteristic of ICE vehicles, consumers can bid farewell to oil changes, filter replacements, failing belts and hoses, and other routine maintenance issues.\\n\\n\\nStop Worrying About When You Are Going to Fuel Up:\\n Think about how in control you’d feel knowing your car is always “topped off.” With an BEV, you essentially own the ability to fuel your car. And, if you can charge at home, work or in public places, you may never have to stop to “fuel up” again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t Forget the Cost\\n\\n\\nCurrently, several BEVs are competing in the luxury car market with a price point and feature set targeting consumers with luxury in mind. Those accustomed to luxury cars expect cool features included in the price premium, but traditional ICE cars tend to have expensive maintenance requirements and depreciate at similar rates to standard cars.\\n\\n\\nFor BEVs, there already exists financial incentives, government subsidies, cheaper fuel and fewer maintenance concerns to help drive down total cost of ownership. What remains to be seen is the resale value and depreciation of BEVs relative to their ICE counterparts. So, when factoring in the total cost of ownership in addition to the cool features, the scales may tip toward BEVs for some buyers.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, \\nDeloitte\\n predicts that by 2022, advances in technology will help equalize the costs of owning a BEV vs. a traditional vehicle. An aggressive prediction to be sure, but as battery costs decrease and production methods improve, costs are coming down. How quickly costs balance with ICE vehicles remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nA New Point of View\\n\\n\\nBEVs have so much more to offer consumers than automakers give them credit for. Rather than positioning them as electric versions of ICE vehicles, it’s time to focus on what consumers really want and how those cars make them feel. GM, Porsche and Audi seem to be getting the message. The three BEV automakers ran \\nSuper Bowl ads\\n that got viewers’ hearts pumping with the sights and sounds of a high-speed car heist, a shattering backboard, and an adrenaline-charged power ballad. They were all about cool first, car second.\\n\\n\\nBy helping buyers look at BEVs in a different light, not only will these cars appeal to a wider range of consumers—including the tech-car enthusiast—but the BEV market as a whole might just get the boost it needs to leave ICE vehicles behind.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to know more about how your business can thrive in this emerging landscape, we can help.

However, despite the automobile industry’s focus on electrifying vehicles and some receptivity among global citizens, consumers still feel anxious about BEV journey range and charging infrastructure. These top two barriers to BEV adoption are well-known among manufacturers pushing battery electric vehicle research and development as fast as they can. Until the BEV industry makes charging at home and work easier as well as increases the visibility and density of public charging points, consumers’ perception of risk in taking long journeys in BEVs will remain high.\\n\\n\\nEscalent’s \\nAutomotive & Mobility\\n team recently explored these issues in a self-funded study and uncovered some good news: Businesses can create a win-win scenario for their brand, consumers and BEV manufacturers\\n if\\n these businesses provide BEV charging stations for employee use.\\n\\n\\nConsumer Attitudes toward BEV Charging at Home and at Work\\n\\n\\nWe first looked into the impact of BEV charging stations and signage on purchase consideration and found an important correlation: approximately \\n30% more US consumers\\n said they would consider purchasing a BEV \\nbecause\\n they saw charging stations and signage. This is good news because it signals that consumers would be receptive to purchasing an electric vehicle when charging infrastructure becomes more ubiquitous.\\n\\n\\nNext, we dug into \\nconsumer attitudes in the US and Europe toward BEV charging\\n at home and at work. We found that relatively few European vehicle owners think it would be easy to charge a BEV at their home or workplace, and we’ve seen similar trends among US car owners.\\n\\n\\nThe ease of BEV charging at home heavily depends on where consumers live. It is relatively easy to charge in the driveway of a suburban home but massively challenging for residents of apartment blocks or urban houses lacking off-street parking.\\n\\n\\nWhen asked about the ease of charging at work, opinion is even more negative—more than half of consumers believe that lack of work charging options will remain the reality.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness Impact on BEV Adoption by Providing Charging Stations\\n\\n\\nWe then conducted research on BEV charging stations at workplaces in the US among both BEV and internal combustion engine (ICE) owners to see if consumer consideration of electric vehicles changes in relation to the availability of workplace charging stations. We hypothesized that consumers would be more inclined to consider BEVs if their workplace made charging stations available for employee use.\\n\\n\\nAnd our hypothesis was correct: 38% of individuals who did not initially consider an electric vehicle and whose workplace did not currently offer charging infrastructure \\nwould consider\\n a BEV if their workplace made charging stations available for employee use.\\n\\n\\nWe also found that almost one-quarter (23%) of respondents who commute to work today have employers that offer BEV charging stations. Among those with a charging station at their place of work, nearly half indicate they do not have to pay to use the station.\\n\\n\\nBusiness Benefit from Providing BEV Charging Stations\\n\\n\\nWhile a confusing picture is emerging of who is responsible for creating and offering BEV charging infrastructure, businesses can encourage BEV adoption by providing charging stations to their employees. This investment is advantageous for businesses because it will attract forward-thinking, tech-savvy, environmentally conscious employees. The company will reap the added corporate benefit of being perceived by current and future employees as an innovative, creative and imaginative corporate leader. Businesses investing in workplace BEV charging stations, alongside manufacturers, mobility providers and other diverse players working to address consumers’ anxieties about electric vehicles, will raise the density and visibility of charging infrastructure for consumers. Motorists will increasingly feel that BEVs are accessible, which is a win-win for everyone involved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe development of the BEV industry is a key focus of our team as we continue to work closely with auto manufacturers, mobility companies and other stakeholders. \\nTo learn more about how the BEV industry can overcome barriers to adoption and encourage consumer purchase consideration, read our latest report: \\nThe Future of BEV: How to Capture the Heart and Minds of Consumers\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethodology: Escalent interviewed a US-based sample of 188 BEV owners, 86 Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle owners and 1,895 ICE owners at least 18 years of age in July to October of 2019.

While low-band 5G does not deliver the game-changing speed enhancements yet to come with full-blown 5G, it opens the door. 5G at its full potential (mid-band) is all about speed and our ability to access, better utilize and improve technology—and all of the telecoms are racing to bring the full potential to their customers.\\n\\n\\nThe implications of what 5G technology brings to other industries are not obvious. With 5G set to make real, tangible strides in 2020 across a variety of technology and telecom applications, Escalent gathered our company’s industry group leaders to outline the unexpected ways in which vastly increased speed, bandwidth, coverage and reliability will shape the future for companies across the breadth of our industry expertise, from tech and telecom to healthcare and everything in between.\\n\\n\\nTechnology\\n & \\nTelecom\\n\\n\\nT-Mobile made 2020 the year of “5G for All,” essentially giving 200 million Americans access to nationwide 5G via its network. Despite a long buildup period by industry players and speculators outlining the benefits of 5G, many consumers have simply shrugged at the premise of a newer, faster standard for their mobile devices, assuming this change will mirror prior incremental advancements.\\n\\n\\nWhile this may feel like an evolution over the existing 4G LTE standard, consumers are in for a surprise when 5G is leveraged to its full capabilities. With the speed and reliability of in-home, wired broadband at consumers’ fingertips wherever they go—including rural areas facing limited in-home and mobile connectivity options—the benefits for video streaming and productivity are apparent.\\n\\n\\n– Nancy Arter, Senior Vice President, Technology & Telecom\\n\\n\\nAutomotive & Mobility\\n\\n\\nThe future of mobility is tightly connected to 5G and similar such technological developments. While most consumers are focused on the current and near-future state of autonomy in their vehicles, what is often lost is the importance of infrastructure support for autonomous vehicles. With 5G’s low latency and high bandwidth, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication will provide exponential developmental leaps for autonomous safety and reliability.\\n\\n\\n5G is one of the cornerstones required to bring the vision of driverless vehicles to life for everyday Americans, from building a foundation of trust and reliability for autonomous services to the creature comforts of on-the-go entertainment and mobile office amenities. For transportation companies, the movement of goods via truck will improve as 5G-connected autonomous delivery vehicles are able to optimize routes in real time and reduce average delivery times.\\n\\n\\n– Jason Mantel, Managing Director, Automotive & Mobility\\n\\n\\nConsumer Goods & Retail\\n\\n\\nBusiness intelligence tools are changing the way retailers do business, offering real-time data and monitoring designed at the store level. Retailers can expect to harness the speed and bandwidth 5G offers to implement these expansive platforms and make the most of them. Additionally, the insights gleaned from these new tools will illustrate new ways business owners can serve their customers’ needs with a keen awareness of their preferences.\\n\\n\\nFor consumers, the transition to 5G means the retail experience becomes even more seamless. Online and mobile ordering options will become more reliable as networks improve, while the fulfillment of those orders may radically change. Imagine automated shoppers designed to assemble shopping baskets in real time so customers need only pull up to an express pickup line for an easy drive-through grocery shopping experience.\\n\\n\\nBusiness leaders and their consumers will feel 5G’s impact at the cash register, wherever that may be in the store. Reliable, high-speed internet access throughout the storefront—or beyond—opens the doors to completely reimagining the way customers interact with a retail space and makes novel concepts like Amazon’s “Go” shopping experience possible at scale. Even stores in remote locations will have a leg up, as they will be able to tap into 5G to serve their connectivity needs and won’t have to rely on traditional, more expensive satellite connections that are more difficult to deploy.\\n\\n\\n– Jill Miller, Senior Director, Consumer & Retail\\n\\n\\nEnergy\\n\\n\\nAs an “always on” industry, the energy industry faces significant infrastructure challenges when building new generation and distribution sites. In addition to the equipment and capabilities required to generate power, remote production sites must have lightning-quick, bulletproof connections for usage, performance, maintenance and production monitoring. To date, those needs have been met only by the capabilities of wired connections. With the ubiquity and “plug-and-play” nature of 5G upon full deployment, providers will be able to set up temporary sites with the same capabilities offered by permanent stations quickly and seamlessly, offering a new level of flexibility in power delivery.\\n\\n\\nIn addition, 5G technology will enable platforms to have significantly more demand flexibility to help integrate increasing amounts of intermittent renewable resources, such as managing EV charging demand in real time based on solar or wind production. Thanks to the low latency 5G offers, frequency regulation will be possible through distributed devices in the home, including water heaters, EVs, home batteries and other demand sources that don’t need to be “always on.”\\n\\n\\nThis functionality is likely to push the smart home to the next level. Utilities will be able to more effectively leverage the smart grid and provide more reliable service via devices and mechanisms that can monitor grid performance and quickly adapt without the need of a wired connection.\\n\\n\\n– Chris Montaglione, Managing Director, Energy\\n\\n\\nFinancial Services\\n\\n\\nThe ATM is about to get a lot more personal. With 5G, banks can implement live-video conferencing in new ATM installations to offer the personalized service of a teller interaction, even in remote locations without a physical bank present. The added benefits of remote, face-to-face banking are countless, from customer service and experience to added security for every transaction.\\n\\n\\nFor trading professionals, speed is money. Individuals and organizations looking to handle and transfer large sums of money will see the benefits of 5G speeds right away. Additionally, advisors will have better access to their clients (and vice versa) for critical, on-demand decision-making via video chat and shared access to supporting information.\\n\\n\\n– Linda York, Senior Vice President, Financial Services\\n\\n\\nHealth\\n\\n\\nSpeed and reliability are among the most important features for any product or service that plugs into our multi-stage healthcare delivery system. With 5G, doctors are handed a whole new set of tools with which to serve patients, from remote specialist consultations to emergency care direction during ambulance rides. Underserved rural communities will gain access to specialists thanks to powerful telemedicine platforms that save lives through faster diagnoses in critical situations and the performance of highly technical procedures remotely via robot.\\n\\n\\nAnother added benefit is real-time, uninterrupted transmission of data from wearable technology and other patient monitoring devices. Data management becomes much easier, too, with high-definition imaging data transferable instantaneously for diagnostics and analysis. Costs and concerns could drop as patients reach improved outcomes quicker and more directly.\\n\\n\\n– Katy Palmer, PhD, Managing Director, Health\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n5G is set to be the biggest improvement to connectivity since high-speed internet took the mantle from dial-up. 5G will enable new products, service offerings, quality-of-life improvements and more across a wide range of industries wherever it is implemented.

In particular, auto manufacturers have already started to embrace and invest in technology that will profoundly affect the industry, transportation infrastructure and on consumers themselves: electric vehicles (EVs).\\n\\n\\nThe potential benefits of EVs are numerous and important. Given the increasing threats of climate change, EVs represent a critical step in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and in bettering our environment. In addition, EVs will provide consumers with lower operating and maintenance costs as compared to conventional vehicles.\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, the trade-offs and barriers to EV adoption are also significant. Range anxiety (i.e., the worry that an EV won’t travel a sufficient distance on a single charge) has been a consistent concern of consumers since EVs’ inception. Additionally, even with the fastest chargers, charging times far exceed the five minutes it takes to fill up the gas tank of vehicles with internal combustion engines. Furthermore, while the number of public charging stations has increased significantly over time, they are still limited in number and would likely be insufficient to meet any major, short-term spike in EVs on the road.\\n\\n\\nAuto\\n manufacturers and \\ntech\\n firms have been working hard to reduce these barriers. Batteries and electronics design have improved to the point where some of the latest models tout driving ranges of nearly 400 miles. Apps are now available to identify the location and availability of public charging stations. Public fast-charging stations are now able to recharge up to 80% of a vehicle’s battery in 30 minutes, and various organizations are working on initiatives to reduce charging times further.\\n\\n\\nWhile the adoption of EVs has grown over time, \\nEV sales in the US still represent less than 2%\\n of the total vehicle market. So, with all of these improvements and the environmental and cost benefits of EVs, why haven’t EV sales been booming? In addition, have tech initiatives really overcome the EV barriers they set out to address? I have some opinions based on my own experience.\\n\\n\\nFunctional Benefits Aren’t Always Enough\\n\\n\\nWhen conducting consumer interviews last year on a wide range of topics including the steps that consumers would willingly take to combat climate change, I asked about the appeal of EVs. Most respondents were notably lukewarm to the general category, yet immediately added as an afterthought, “Now Tesla. That’s an EV that I could get excited about!” In probing further, the interest in Tesla wasn’t based so much on its environmental benefits, but rather its sleek, sexy styling and “cool” image. Given that the styling and image are combined with impressive battery \\ntechnology\\n and a host of tech features, it is little wonder that Tesla has dominated the US EV market.\\n\\n\\nThe Chevy Bolt is the second most popular EV in the US, but still suffered an almost 9% drop in sales this past year. \\n\\xa0In its marketing materials, Chevy emphasizes the Bolt’s impressive driving range, low cost of ownership, safety and several other features. My middle brother, a proud Chevy Bolt owner, validates that these claims are true, but he also stresses an emotional benefit that Chevy fails to tout: the Bolt \\nis fun to drive\\n. With much more torque than internal combustion engines, the Bolt (and EVs in general) can accelerate faster, which makes merging with and maneuvering around traffic easier and more enjoyable. Yet, when it comes to marketing, Chevy appears to be promoting the Bolt on its functional and practical merits only rather than including an appeal to any emotional motivators (i.e., being fun to drive).\\n\\n\\nCharging: Not as Simple as it Seems\\n\\n\\nA little over a year ago, my Chevy Bolt-owning brother decided that he wanted to see if we could make the drive from the San Francisco Bay Area to Lake Tahoe. Knowing that the Bolt couldn’t reach the destination on a single charge, my brother’s first task was to figure out where one could find charging stations along the way. So, unlike traveling in a conventional vehicle with easy access to ubiquitous gas stations along the way, it became clear that EV charging would be more challenging because it involves up-front planning (e.g., knowing how far your vehicle can go, where charging stations are located, and being smart about when to stop to recharge).\\n\\n\\nAfter mapping out the trip and checking his charging station app, my brother came up with a plan to drive to a station about halfway to our destination. With our charging plan addressed, our next objective was to drive to the charging station and plug in and charge for about 45 minutes while we went to lunch.\\n\\n\\nOn our travel day, all looked good. As we got near the charging station, the app gave us the precise location of the station and reassured us that no one was currently using the charger. However, when we finally reached the charging station, we found only one small problem: a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was parked in the charging space! Fortunately, after monitoring the situation for 15 minutes or so, the offending vehicle and owner moved on and we were finally able to begin charging.\\n\\n\\nThe final challenge was climbing the Sierra Nevada mountains to get to Lake Tahoe. After recharging and embarking on the second half of our journey, the Bolt initially indicated that we would have more than enough battery life to get us to our destination. However, the additional variable to consider was altitude gain. Lake Tahoe sits at an elevation of over 6,000 feet, so climbing mountains to get there drains the battery at a much faster rate. As we gained elevation, our eyes were glued to the Bolt gauge as it continued to recalculate and reduce our projected driving range. While we held our breath climbing to the top of the pass, we made it to the cabin with 30 “driving miles” to spare.\\n\\n\\nDelivering on the Promise of EV\\n\\n\\nSo, what are the lessons learned from these Tesla and Chevy Bolt experiences? Here are three take-aways:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppeal to Head and Heart\\n\\n\\nSince EVs offer some important functional benefits achieved through impressive technology, it is not surprising that some manufacturers have focused on function and technology to sell their products. However, consumers have long been motivated by other factors such as brand image, styling and design. Tesla has shown that consumers may \\nvalue\\n the functional benefits of an environmentally friendly vehicle and extended driving range, but they will \\nbecome excited and motivated\\n by the emotional benefits of a vehicle that looks good, feels good and is fun to drive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccess Comes Not Just from Products, But from Their Infrastructure\\n\\n\\nIt is clear that the success of EVs will depend on a large, \\nwell-developed battery-charging infrastructure\\n. Given the critical role of infrastructure, EV manufacturers that ignore this dependence and focus only on their products do so at their peril. Instead, these manufacturers should also be very concerned with developing initiatives and partnerships to establish a robust EV ecosystem that:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnlarges the network of charging stations: \\nEV enthusiasts may not mind the hunt for charging stations during long-distance trips, but many other drivers will expect the kind of convenient access they get from gas stations today.\\n\\n\\nAddresses battery charging throughput: \\nConsumers are not likely to want to wait in lines behind other vehicles that take 30–45 minutes to charge. Industry players will need to consider a variety of potential solutions such as reducing charging time, installing more charging stations or even converting gas stations into roadside charging stations with coffeehouses and/or restaurants for customers as they wait for their vehicles to charge.\\n\\n\\nCreates smarter charging technology and enforcement measures: \\nCharging stations will need to become increasingly smart to monitor and record non-EVs that park in charging spaces. Collaboration with state and local officials will also be needed to enforce parking for battery charging (i.e., pass laws and enforce them by ticketing parking offenders).\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEliminate Long-Range Travel Anxiety and Guesswork\\n\\n\\nThe increased driving ranges of the most recent EV models should comfortably meet the needs of those with short commutes and those who drive in the general vicinity of their homes. With the installation of faster home chargers, these EV drivers can easily keep their vehicles charged and ready to go without worrying about public charging stations. However, EV adoption will really take off when consumers are as comfortable taking their EV on long-range trips as they are driving around town. In order to do that, manufacturers will need to find ways to make the process of monitoring and charging batteries less burdensome and anxiety-producing. Certainly, increasing the number of public charging stations will help significantly over time. In the meantime, manufacturers and third parties need to build on existing apps to provide more real-time information automatically. Instead of having drivers search out stations on a map and then figure out on their own which stations to seek out, smart apps could be created that could automatically recommend optimal stations based on the remaining driving range. Additionally, for trips with varying terrain (e.g., mountain ranges), smart apps could be developed where drivers enter their destinations prior to their trips. In turn, the app could then take into account elevation change and remaining driving range to estimate whether drivers would have enough battery charge to reach their desired destinations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMake it Easy for the EV Consumer\\n\\n\\nIn summary, it seems that the rate of EV adoption will depend in large part on \\nhow easy\\n the industry makes it for consumers to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFall in love with EVs through emotional as well as rational appeals\\n\\n\\nAccess and utilize the battery charging infrastructure they need\\n\\n\\nEnjoy long-range trips without the anxiety and burden of excessive planning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you like what we have to say here, you’ll be excited to know that we released a great white paper that does a deeper dive in the US as well as Europe on EVs, also referred to as BEVs: \\nThe Future of BEVs: How to Capture the Hearts and Minds of Consumers\\n.'}\n","{'Index': 114, 'Heading': 'How Disruptive Pricing Will Impact Consumers and Automotive Manufacturers in the UK and US', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/how-disruptive-pricing-will-impact-consumers-and-automotive-manufacturers-in-the-uk-and-us/', 'Content': 'In both the UK and US, there is currently a real risk for political dynamics to result in the imposition of trade tariffs that have selective, disruptive effects on various product categories.\\n\\n\\nTraditionally, vehicle manufacturers have been able to introduce modest price rises almost indiscernibly. Sometimes, currency fluctuations may also serve to inflate prices but, critically, neither mechanism tends to disrupt the pricing hierarchy.\\n\\n\\nIf sizeable tariffs are applied to vehicle brands from specific countries or regions, there is potential for the pricing hierarchy of brands to be massively disrupted.\\n\\n\\nSo, how might car buyers react to massive overnight price hikes for various car brands? We conducted a small scale, attitudinal study in the UK and US to determine what car buyers would actually do in various scenarios.\\n\\n\\nIt is clear in both countries that, faced with a discernibly higher price, car buyer behaviour would scatter in all sorts of different directions. In the UK, only 17% of car buyers would stick with their original make/model preference. A further one third would likely stay with their preferred brand but also seek a means of mitigating the price increase by down-grading on trim levels or segment. With one quarter delaying the time of purchase and another 14% intending to switch brand, it can be seen that close to 40% of buyers would adopt a behaviour that would deliver the most disruptive outcome for their preferred brand.\\n\\n\\nIn the US, the impact of the significant price increases would be even more disruptive—27% would delay the purchase while 37% would switch brand, either within the same segment or down-grading.\\n\\n\\nWhile the UK responses were in reaction to a 20% price increase, the results indicate that US car buyers are particularly price sensitive—over 20% would react in response to a 5% increase while a further 50% would feel the need to re-appraise their vehicle choice if the price hike hit the 15% threshold.\\n\\n\\nSo, What Does This Mean for Auto Manufacturers?\\n\\n\\nSevere price increases imposed via tariffs that brands have no control over create massive market challenges. Margins are already incredibly tight, so significant discounting is akin to commercial self-harming. Promotion of different ownership models may represent a medium to long-term means of mitigating some of these effects.\\n\\n\\nFor any car buyer, there is always a personal value for “money equation” to be satisfied—in other words, balancing what the buyer gets for what they have to pay for it. While geo-politics might influence the “pay” side of the equation, manufacturers can always influence the “what the buyer gets” element by ensuring they build as much equity as they can into their make/model proposition. This translates into ensuring that, through all forms of marketing communications, manufacturers sharply focus on projecting to potential consumers the most influential and resonating benefits that are present in both the brand and the models.\\n\\n\\nThere is never a bad time to reinforce the equity in a brand or its vehicles—but at a time when there is a risk of disruptive pricing, it becomes even more imperative.\\n\\n\\nOur \\nAutomotive & Mobility\\n team is deeply embedded in the global auto industry as it undergoes ever-growing disruption and transformation. \\nFeel free to send us a note with your questions and challenges—we can help you get ahead of the curve of this dynamic market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThis blog post references data from two Escalent studies.

Even the casual observer knows this is no longer the case. The proliferation of technology, data and digital communication has put an ever-increasing amount of control in the hands of consumers. Nowadays, an assertion made by a brand regarding the benefits of an offering, i.e., an advertising claim, can readily be verified through objective measurement or subjective experience, and the results easily shared with a global audience.\\n\\n\\nThis democratization of information has been great for individuals (ask anyone who has recently purchased a motor vehicle), but has it benefited brands as well? The answer is a hearty but qualified yes. In order to reap the benefits of this paradigm shift, it is incumbent on brands to \\nbe honest.\\n It is well-established that deception is toxic to any relationship, including that of brands and consumers. Honest \\nbrand management\\n and communication helps build trust and works toward the holy grail of brands, authenticity. Conversely, a deception is likely to be uncovered, leading to backlash that often negates any short-term gains. The \\nnews has been rife with high-profile examples\\n of this in recent years, leaving many offenders with an expensive and years-long effort to rebuild trust in the brand.\\n\\n\\nIf the truth is both powerful and necessary when building trusted and authentic brands, why are false or misleading advertising claims still out there?\\n The answer: the truth isn’t always easy. Let’s look at some of the forces at work that cause even highly reputable brands to occasionally make claims that are ultimately judged to be false or misleading.\\n\\n\\nAdvertising speech in the US is regulated. The FTC lays it out plainly: \\n“federal law says that [ads] must be truthful, not misleading, and, when appropriate, backed by scientific evidence.”\\n Most advertisers spend a fair amount of time and money to collect this type of information to support their claims. When the science is done in good faith but a claim still falls short of the truth standard, it is usually because there is a disconnect between the science and the manner in which the advertiser expresses the claim. For example, if a given product is shown to be preferred over a competitive product but the people asked to compare the products were not representative of the population as a whole, the advertiser is being less than truthful if they make an unqualified preference claim.\\n\\n\\nThere are several reasons that false or misleading claims are made. Here are some examples:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNavigating the regulatory landscape requires that advertisers have access to the appropriate legal and research experts, and many advertisers, particularly smaller ones, simply don’t have the required access.\\n\\n\\nThe body of evidence intended to support a claim might be incomplete coupled with time pressures that do not allow for sufficiently robust science.\\n\\n\\nSome advertisers place short-term gain ahead of more noble pursuits like satisfying consumers and telling the truth and hope that consumers won’t know, care or remember.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the ever-increasing scrutiny by regulators and competitors and the infinite memory of the internet, it is natural to wonder why an advertiser would take on the risk associated with making an advertising claim that is not fully supported. Many industry categories are saturated with highly optimized offerings, creating an economy of virtually unlimited choice. This creates two opposing forces—the differences between offerings is shrinking while the need to stand out is growing. Further hampering an offering’s ability to stand out in a world of unlimited options is that consumers will always have limited bandwidth. Getting a consumer to tolerate a brand’s interruption and devote some attention to it often feels like an impossible task, requiring companies to create advertisements that hit the tiny sweet spot of personal relevance, contextual relevance, and enjoyment.\\n\\n\\nThe good news for brands is that despite the challenges created by the complex consumer, marketplace and regulatory landscapes, brands that communicate the truths of functionality and experience tend to build healthier, more profitable and more enduring brands (\\ncheck out Unerman and Baskin’s “Tell the Truth” for more on this\\n).

While companies merge for many reasons, the need to \\nexpand the customer base in existing geographic\\n \\nmarkets\\n remains a consistent top reason to merge with or acquire another company. \\nWhy, then, do so many companies lose track of the customer experience during the transition?\\n\\n\\nThe \\ntelecom industry\\n experiences an extraordinary amount of merger activity, so Escalent took a look at the experience and the impact on customers. Our study uncovered a gap between customer expectations and company communication during the merger process. This lack of communication often generates anxiety among the customer base. However, \\nif a company can bridge customer expectations and communication, there are opportunities to engage a new set of customers while reinvigorating loyal customers.\\n\\n\\nExecuting a successful merger is a Herculean task.

Ridesharing has become a reliable and relatively safe option for out-of-town business and vacation travel, getting around locally, or simply when in a pinch. A growing number of consumers, especially in urban markets, are even opting to forego private vehicle ownership altogether given the convenience of summoning a rideshare service with the push of a button on a phone app. The appeal of no parking, insurance, fuel, maintenance and, of course, personal responsibility has won over many, even if the collective economics and other conveniences aren’t in favor of ridesharing when traveling a significant number of miles each year.\\n\\n\\nBased on our June-July 2019 Escalent Automotive Consumer Pulse Study, an online survey* conducted monthly among approximately 1,000 US adults 18 years of age and older, one-third of the US adult population are already using rideshare services to varying degrees. Nearly half of these riders have an experience with a rideshare provider at least monthly, which translates to a significant cross-section of exposure to automotive brands. But do these rides have an impact on how consumers perceive automotive brands? Or, perhaps better asked, CAN these rides have an impact on automotive brand perceptions?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRidesharing to Increase Vehicle Sales\\n\\n\\nThere’s plenty of debate around predictions of the impact of ridesharing on new vehicle sales. While an increasing number of consumers may avoid car ownership, the \\noverall vehicle-miles traveled will likely not decline\\n and are projected to potentially increase as new audiences–such as elderly or disabled people–have growing access to this game-changing mobility option. Therefore, given the faster rate at which miles accumulate, we expect that rideshare vehicle replacement will be on a shorter time cycle than privately-owned vehicles. The need or desire for new technology and vehicle features may also trigger rideshare vehicle owners to purchase new cars sooner, in order to avoid varying degrees of vehicle obsolescence. Rideshare volume (miles driven) is also taking away from traditional mass transit options (such as subway, bus, shuttle, light rail) and, of course, has significantly up-ended the taxi and rental car industry–all supporting the potential for increased vehicle sales.\\n\\n\\nBranding Opportunities with Rideshare Riders\\n\\n\\nWhile the potential for increased new car sales due to ridesharing sounds like a windfall for OEMs, the \\nrole of the brand\\n itself has the potential to be diluted and considered a commodity to end users of ridesharing services, especially since riders don’t typically have a choice of brand. We dug into this in our study and asked participants about the importance of various aspects of ridesharing. It turns out that the “brand” of rideshare vehicle falls low on the importance continuum for riders when asked how important which brand or model of vehicle picks them up, so long as it is on time and meets their size needs. More than 3 out of 5 people indicated they have no preference at all which brand of vehicle they ride in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis may seem like counterbalancing bad news for carmakers. However, this can also be interpreted as an opportunity for automotive manufacturers to create a brand impression and experience with as much as one third of the population. This is a significant, captive audience to engage as future prospects and brand advocates, albeit predominantly from the back seat. Rideshare users represent a sizable and growing target audience that marketers should be clamoring to engage using both subtle and overt cues–particularly in models that lend themselves to rideshare usage.\\n\\n\\nRideshare Branding Recommendations\\n\\n\\nRiders, of course, will have preoccupations during their ride other than observing the vehicle they’re in. However, OEMs have the opportunity to help riders take notice of the vehicle they are riding in, and create or change their brand perceptions. Delivering or conveying the highest order needs, such as safety, quality, harmony, and comfort (seat comfort, ride comfort, legroom, comfort of entry, noise, and climate) will leave riders feeling that the vehicle brand can be trusted and is a leader – and may even pleasantly surprise riders. Providing personalization, such as individual climate control, infotainment options, and other connected features, signals a brand that delivers more than expected. Perhaps the most overlooked opportunity is the presence of branding itself with placement of brand logos and naming to reinforce which brand of vehicle riders are experiencing. Having rideshare drivers who are advocates for the vehicle brand would be an added bonus, and might be had for little or no additional cost.\\n\\n\\nAdmittedly, investing in rear seat appointments runs counterintuitive with typical vehicle usage patterns for some classes of privately-owned vehicles; but the stakes are high enough to make a statement with the rideshare audience. It is also noteworthy that every effort to engage rideshare riders can also be a plus for rideshare vehicle owners. Being a differentiated rideshare brand will pay dividends on all fronts. \\nSend us a note\\xa0to learn more about how your brand could engage this new and evolving pool of consumers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*Escalent interviewed a national sample of 2,000 consumers aged 18 and up between June and July of 2019.\\xa0Respondents were recruited from the Dynata and Ipsos panel of US adults and were interviewed online.\\xa0Quotas were put in place to achieve a sample of age, gender, income, and ethnicity that matches the demographics of the US population.\\xa0Due to its opt-in nature, this online panel (like most others) does not yield a random probability sample of the target population.\\xa0As such, it is not possible to compute a margin of error or to statistically quantify the accuracy of projections.

I thought this was just a saying, like an old wives tale, but there is scientific evidence to suggest time really does go by faster as we age. This phenomenon is related to how the brain encodes memories. The brain takes longer to process a first-time event and store it in memory compared to habitual experiences. Since the brain is not “slowed down” with processing and storing a continuous flow of first-time events, we tend to feel time passes very quickly the older we get.\\n\\n\\nIt’s already been two years since we started asking people about their awareness of, and opinions about, autonomous vehicles (AV) in our Automotive Consumer Pulse Study, an online survey* conducted monthly among approximately 1,000 U.S. adults 18 years of age and older. But it seems like yesterday when we were looking at the first round of results and feeling a bit surprised about respondents’ openness to self-driving vehicles.\\n\\n\\nAdvancements in the AV Industry\\n\\n\\nAs the last couple of years have flown by, a lot has happened in the AV world. The industry is moving away from the term “autonomous” and is now using “automated.” OEMs and tech companies have backed off on their AV launch dates, while still spending billions on R&D and partnership \\ninvestments\\n. Whereas in March 2018, an Uber car was unfortunately involved in a fatal pedestrian \\naccident\\n in Arizona, by the end of the year, Waymo had finished pilot testing and launched its \\nself-driving taxi service\\n in four suburbs around Phoenix, Arizona. \\nPartners for Automated Vehicle Education\\n (PAVE) —a coalition of industry, nonprofit, and academic institutions—was established late 2018, with the sole goal to inform and educate the public and policymakers on the facts regarding automated vehicles.\\n\\n\\nIt will be no easy task for OEMs to transform their brand from a legacy car manufacturer to a trustworthy provider of mobility products and services. Layer in the complexity of human behavior—where we don’t always behave as expected—and it’s no wonder many OEMs have pushed the release of their \\nfirst fully self-driving car\\n to 2021. Part of this delay is directly related to customers’ use of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), which is the foundation for higher levels of \\nautomated vehicle features\\n. There is still a tremendous amount to learn about the interaction between driver and automated vehicle features, especially in terms of driver reliance on ADAS features and vehicle monitoring of driver behavior.\\n\\n\\nEarning and Building Consumer Trust in AVs\\n\\n\\nIt is extremely important for OEMs not to take for granted the process of building trust, with customers, in their new products and services. Developing initial trust—and sustaining that trust—will require OEMs to consistently deliver on two prerequisites inherent in human behavior:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst and foremost, we must feel safe and secure riding in an automated vehicle.\\n Unlike traditional vehicles wherein consumers perceive safety risks around crash worthiness and reliability, we need to feel assured and confident that connected AVs will be safe from hacking and an invasion of privacy.\\n\\n\\nHuman nature is also about asking: “What’s in it for me?”\\n Delivering on perceived benefits and usefulness of automated vehicles will be critical in developing initial trust and, ultimately, accepting AVs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe emotion of trust and associated feelings are a very individualistic experience. This needs to be respected when designing, educating, and communicating the ease of use, benefits, and risks of AVs. Education needs to be multi-faceted, taking into consideration different learning styles, generational differences, and cultural influences. Marketing communications need to be tailored—one size will not fit all—taking into account personality types, prior knowledge, and personal experiences.\\n\\n\\nAn Autonomous Future\\n\\n\\nThere is no doubt OEMs will successfully accomplish their mission of introducing us to a new era of innovation in transportation. They will figure out the technology to make us feel safe and secure, and they will embrace the complexity of human behavior associated with accepting advanced technology that allows vehicles to drive themselves. If done right, experiencing automated vehicles will be a first-time experience—one that is pleasurable, memorable, and slows the passage of time, if only for a moment.\\n\\n\\nIn view of OEMs achieving this, Escalent investigated why consumers are so uncertain about automated vehicles and how manufacturers can build public trust in our report: \\nAn Autonomous Future: Building Trust in a Driverless World\\n.\\n\\n\\nClick below to download your copy of \\nAn Autonomous Future: Building Trust in a Driverless World\\n.'}\n","{'Index': 119, 'Heading': 'The Trust Factor: How Can Mobility Providers Overcome Consumer Fears of Self-Driving Tech to Achieve AV Acceptance?', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/the-trust-factor-how-can-mobility-providers-overcome-consumer-fears-of-self-driving-tech-to-achieve-av-acceptance/', 'Content': 'Electric vehicles, connectivity, shared mobility, and self-driving technologies are simultaneously converging in development in the automotive and mobility space. New vehicles are filled to the brim with the latest tech offerings to enhance the driving experience for the consumer. And consumers have generally embraced onboard technologies. Whether they realize it or not, many are already driving with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). According to a \\n2018 study\\n, 89% of the motoring public would buy another car with at least one ADAS feature.\\n\\n\\nThis is good news because the US government mandated that ADAS—which offers a subset of autonomous features—will be in 100% of new American cars by 2020, and carmakers are forging ahead in their eager pursuit of building fully autonomous vehicles. There will be an estimated \\n33 million autonomous vehicles\\n sold annually by 2040—a mere twenty years down the line.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, the general public is reluctant to give up \\nfull\\n driving control to autonomous vehicles. \\nRoughly one in five people\\n is willing to ride in a self-driving car even though human error is the contributing cause of \\n94% of vehicle accidents\\n.\\n\\n\\nWe heard this public reluctance echoed in the resounding “No” voiced from five millennials on a consumer panel that Escalent facilitated at the 2018 ADAS & Autonomous Vehicle USA Conference. No, they would not step foot inside an autonomous vehicle for a variety of reasons rooted in a lack of trust. The engineers in the audience were surprised with this response but the panel’s candid answer reflected the fear felt by \\n73% of drivers\\n who indicated they would be “too afraid” to ride in a self-driving vehicle in a 2018 AAA study.\\n\\n\\nSo, as the race towards autonomous mobility continues, there is one key question that every manufacturer should be asking…\\n\\n\\nHow can mobility providers build consumer trust in fully autonomous vehicles in the near future?\\n\\n\\nThe lack of consumer trust is not a new barrier to AV adoption but it is one that continues to persist. News of accidents and deaths resulting from imperfect self-driving vehicles only serve to validate, if not heighten, consumer skepticism and fear. In their quest to fully automate driving, it is vital for automotive manufacturers to keep a close pulse on consumer sentiment to make sure they actively bring the public along as they continue to develop AVs.\\n\\n\\nSome are taking note. Carmakers have begun revising timelines to release self-driving vehicles because they do not want to risk increasing consumer fear and mistrust in the evolving technology. \\nCruise\\n, the self-driving unit of GM, \\nrecently announced\\n they will not be deploying self-driving taxis by the end of 2019, as originally planned, with CEO Dan Ammann saying \\n“he’s being cautious about deploying the technology in cars on public roads, and making sure the public is ready. Any snafu could set back regulatory and public support.”\\n\\n\\nHaving worked with manufacturers and automotive organizations across the globe for over 40 years, our \\nAutomotive & Mobility\\n team at Escalent dug deeper into this question of public fear and trust in autonomous vehicles. We sought to answer a few key, strategic questions for automotive and mobility companies:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can carmakers—eager to roll out the newest mobility technologies—ensure there’s a willing market to embrace these tech offerings?\\n\\n\\nWill we, as humans, ever be willing to give up full control for the sake of heralding an autonomous future? Even one which holds the promise of affordable and safe mobility for everyone, at anytime, anywhere?\\n\\n\\nWhat can mobility providers do to address this public fear and skepticism as they strive to offer the full potential of autonomous mobility?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe explore the answers to this and more in \\nAn Autonomous Future: Building Trust in a Driverless World\\n, and provide a set of strategic recommendations designed to help carmakers and mobility companies understand what it will take to shift this public paradigm.\\n\\n\\nClick below to download your copy of \\nAn Autonomous Future: Building Trust in a Driverless World\\n.'}\n","{'Index': 120, 'Heading': 'EV Infrastructure and Signage Increase Purchase Consideration', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/ev-infrastructure-and-signage-increase-purchase-consideration/', 'Content': 'As an avid consumer of automotive-related media, I have a heightened awareness of automotive and mobility messages vying for my attention.

First, we probed their “intention to buy an EV” before inquiring about their awareness of EV charging infrastructure or signage. While there are many factors that can influence a purchase decision, we specifically wanted to test our hypothesis that seeing more EV infrastructure and signage would have a positive impact on consumers and increase their confidence to purchase EVs.\\n\\n\\nThe results of our initial research were illuminating.

Free soloing is lone climbing without ropes or harnesses. El Capitan is a 3,000-foot vertical granite slab. If you haven’t seen it, treat yourself to the 2019 Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo. It is a nail-biting study of human achievement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: \\nRolling Stone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFree Solo’s\\n climbing footage is breathtaking. But it’s the character study within the film that I was drawn to. It’s not just the story of someone driven to do something remarkable. It’s also about the less remarked upon, painstaking work of research, analysis, modeling, and planning that went into it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs insights professionals, particularly those who specialize in \\nMarket Opportunity Assessment\\n and \\nM&A research\\n, our primary value is to assess potential paths to growth and minimize risk. We do that through painstaking assessment, methodically studying markets and their macro and micro attributes. We help to visualize an all-encompassing, geographically nuanced map of industry landscapes, market trends, and competition. Mountains, like new markets, pose multiple routes of ascent, and our role is to help identify which pathway is most viable and how to avoid falling rocks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGranted, in our business, lives do not hang by fingertips. But as strategic consultants, we do play a critical role in the high-stakes decision-making of our clients. So here are a few Free Solo observations for those who rely on insights to make consequential decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlex Honnold Is Not a Risk-Taker\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn one of many post-climb interviews, \\nJimmy Kimmel\\n asks Honnold if he was ever afraid. To which he offers a perfectly reasoned, matter-of-fact response: \\n“I probably would be if I hadn’t prepared for it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHis response goes to the core of risk. Honnold sees scaling 3,000 feet of vertical granite without a rope as a low-risk activity. Why? Because he’s a professional climber who has spent countless hours on rock faces across the world. He studies, maniacally, every inch of every surface. Every move is endlessly choreographed. He keeps a detailed journal of every climb and physically and mentally replays these climbs on horizontal ground. He inhabits the minds of climbers who came before him, studying their moves and learning from their mistakes. For someone who climbs without ropes, he is kind of a belt-and-suspenders guy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHonnold spent over a year preparing for El Cap (and many years before that simply imagining it was possible). His preparation included about 50 roped climbs, including a ‘mountain sweep’ in the days preceding the free solo. He and a climbing partner checked every inch of the route for loose rocks, birds’ nests, or any other foreseeable factors that could send him to his death.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor every climb, with ropes or without, Honnold is consummately prepared. To him, the risk is low.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the consequences are high.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInsights Should Put Clients “IN THE EXPERIENCE”\\n\\n\\n“People need to differentiate risk and consequence,” says Honnold. “You can’t determine risk just by seeing a photo [of a rock face]. You can’t tell how solid I am, how hard the climbing is—all the different factors that go into determining whether or not something is risky. You can’t really judge that unless you’re in the experience.”\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe same kind of relentless preparation and planning goes into scaling the mountains of new markets or acquisitions: a punctilious analysis of conditions, players, opportunities and threats. It’s about taking into account all these factors and meticulously choreographing each foothold forward. Preparation can’t alter the consequence of a business decision, but it certainly alters the risk.\\n\\n\\nAnd to Honnold’s point about being “in the experience,” in our role as insights professionals, thorough-going analyses of potential actions require first-hand knowledge of the realities on the ground. When we are evaluating market potential, we can make assessments based on a number of objective factors. There are regulatory conditions, either favorable or unfavorable. There are competitive dynamics that can either prove difficult or signal an opportunity. And there are also cultural nuances that call for a deeper understanding. Differences in local attitudes and traditions can impact how a brand should behave and communicate in that market.\\n\\n\\nEvery mountain poses a unique challenge. The value that insights providers deliver is to reveal those challenges, chart an optimal path of ascent and make that mountain as real as possible for our clients.\\n\\n\\nThe same goes with M&A research when we help clients see the behaviors and leanings of a company’s customer base or hear the perspectives of people within a merger-worthy organization.\\n\\n\\nOur role as researchers isn’t to deliver an assessment in the form of a hundred pounds of cross tabs. Instead, when we help clients hear the markets, visualize the conditions, and feel the climb, we prepare them for a successful outcome. When we put clients “in the experience” and help them picture—like Alex, each maneuver, we arm them with the confidence to reach for that next nub of granite.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s OKAY to BAIL\\n\\n\\nThere’s a riveting scene in the film where Alex prepares for an ascent in the early hours of a November morning, 2016. This was to be the day he free soloed El Capitan. But he appears to have woken up on the wrong side of the van he lives in. The cameras capture an alert but visibly irritated Honnold. Someone clearly not in a state of flow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYet Alex is prepared, and he is motivated to achieve the climb before season’s end, which is quickly approaching. He also later admits to a feeling of indebtedness to the film crew who, like him, had been patiently preparing for this moment. His desire to reward their confidence in him—like the pressure of pleasing investors and other stakeholders, threatens his ability to make clear-eyed judgments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlex got only a few hundred feet before turning back, using fixed ropes for his descent (no one free climbs backward). It’s impossible to know whether, by climbing down, he simply delayed his achievement or avoided certain death. But it is possible, I think, to look at this as an insight-driven decision.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs strategists and research partners, we must keep in mind that there are two types of conditions that impact a client’s decisions.\\n\\n\\nThere are external conditions. For those, we can do a lot to help overcome external obstacles and leverage favorable conditions. In Alex’s case, the external conditions on the day of his aborted attempt were the same as they were seven months later. All the information about where to deploy dyno moves, finger locks, and heel hooks were the same as they were on the day he succeeded. Nonetheless, he bailed.\\n\\n\\nThat’s because there were internal conditions Alex could not explain—some having to do with the film crew’s presence. At that time, he did not have enough insight into the meaning of these factors and how they might impact his goal.\\n\\n\\nThe same can be true for our clients. Our assessment of external conditions may provide the insight a client needs to understand that a new market or a potential acquisition presents compelling opportunities. But the ability to take advantage of those opportunities depends on more than an external assessment. It’s also about assessing one’s own readiness to take advantage of that opportunity. As research partners, we must stay keenly attuned to the internal conditions that affect client readiness.\\n\\n\\nThe question is not, “Is it the right time to climb a mountain?” Instead, the question is, “Is it the right time for you to climb this mountain?”\\n\\n\\nOf course, the more we know about internal conditions, the more prepared we can be to either support the next foothold forward or plan a measured retreat.\\n\\n\\nIn the case of a retreat, was all that research and analysis of external conditions a waste? Absolutely not! Indeed, it is often because of everything a client knows externally that they can be more attuned to the internal nagging of the unknown. In other words, all that meticulous and painstaking research, planning and strategizing should also arm decision-makers with the confidence to bail.\\n\\n\\nAt Escalent, we specialize in \\nM&A research\\n and assessing \\nmarket opportunities\\n.

This allows you to be more nimble in obtaining actionable customer insight. If you receive a response or finding that you were not expecting, you have the ability with an Insight Community to re-focus, adjust your research activity, and dig deeper to obtain greater insight—all within a matter of hours or days. The ability to shift like this and have sample readily available allows you to continually learn from your customers and engage with them on a timely basis.\\n\\n\\nExample\\n\\n\\nLet’s say you work for a company that is developing an updated mobile app for your customers. With an Insight Community, you can make changes to your research activities on the fly and adjust to varying needs based on the feedback you receive from your customers. For example, if you receive customer feedback that they have issues logging into the original mobile app, you can ask questions to your community to dig deeper on this point, understand more about the issues they are facing, and make updates to the login feature of the app while still staying on course with your overall objective. Additionally, you can reach back out to the customers you spoke with to share the changes you made and work with them on an end-product with which everyone will be satisfied. Through this approach, you will be more intimately including your customers in the development of the updated mobile app that will best serve their needs—thereby increasing their investment and loyalty in your brand.\\n\\n\\nWhy do Insight Communities Work?\\n\\n\\nWe find that the primary reason people join a community is to provide their input and be a part of a team where their feedback is appreciated and put to good use. By creating a community of a set of customers, you have members who want to provide feedback and value being part of the process. As a result, you’ll receive more thoughtful responses and more open dialogue. This translates into superior response rates and deeper insights that you can receive in weeks instead of months.\\n\\n\\nHere at Escalent, we have partnered with numerous clients across the \\nautomotive and mobility\\n, \\nconsumer goods and retail\\n, \\nfinancial\\n, and \\nhealth\\n industries to create communities that provide an agile solution to insight needs. \\nIf you want to learn more about how to \\nleverage this solution\\n and partner with your customers, we’re ready to work with you so send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 123, 'Heading': 'Lessons Learned Traveling the World to Conduct Qualitative Research', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/lessons-learned-traveling-the-world-to-conduct-qualitative-research/', 'Content': 'As a researcher who devoted 10 years to conducting multi-country international qualitative research, too many times I hear clients talking about international qualitative research like it’s just an extension of their US research. In some cases, qualitative research conducted outside of the US (OUS) may be a lot like US research, but assuming that what works in the US is going to work well in other countries can result in a lot of unpleasant surprises.\\n\\n\\nFor example, the first time I did research in India, I hadn’t arranged for a simultaneous translator because I assumed the respondents spoke English. They definitely did, but as the conversation during the focus group grew animated, they started lapsing into “Hinglish,” switching between English and Hindi—sometimes even in the same sentence. I was totally lost. I learned that lesson quickly and had a simultaneous translator with me by the next day. But there are a lot of other things that I learned along the way, and I hope this blog post will spare you from making some of the same mistakes!\\n\\n\\nThe meaning of “on-time” interviews\\n\\n\\nTake something as simple as the start and end times for a focus group. In the US, if the group is supposed to start at 6 pm, it generally starts somewhere around 6 pm—maybe a few minutes late but no big deal—and if it runs a little longer than the two hours planned, also usually no big deal.\\n\\n\\nSo, when your client arrives for a 6 pm focus group in a Latin American (LATAM) country, they may be expecting it to start at 6pm – and then they start getting agitated when it’s 7 pm and still no signs of starting. I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve seen a focus group in Mexico or Brazil start even close to “on time.” And if the topics aren’t all covered and the group is still talking two hours later, that’s usually fine, too… especially since your 8 pm group isn’t going to start on time either. But in other markets like Germany and Japan, research starts and ends on time—to start late or keep a respondent over is unacceptably rude so you’d better be ready to start and finish right on time. Managing expectations ahead of time can help any agitation a client might feel about an interview that is starting “late” or is ended abruptly at the “end time.”\\n\\n\\nYour methodology might vary\\n\\n\\nThere have been a lot of advances in qualitative methodologies, and we’re able to conduct online research in a much wider range of countries than ever before, but the same rules don’t always apply internationally. Researchers and clients in the US love online bulletin boards for their ability to get a wide range of responses that can be probed in real time. But, unless your client is fluent in multiple languages, online bulletin boards outside of the US can’t be followed in real time—it is almost cost-prohibitive to follow them at all when you think about the translation costs for the huge amounts of data that an online bulletin board can generate. And in some cultures like Japan, it isn’t considered culturally appropriate to conduct research via online bulletin boards, as older generations prefer face to face and privacy concerns about sharing on the internet are prevalent.\\n\\n\\nOf course, there are workarounds like machine translation or having the analysis done in-country by a native speaker, but it’s something that has to be considered during the planning phase. The same can apply for telephone interviews—while US clients are used to being able to dial in and listen, simultaneous translation over a telephone can pose problems—not to mention the time difference: is someone really available at 4 am on a Saturday to listen live to physician research taking place in Japan (which often takes place over the weekend)?\\n\\n\\nIn almost every market in the world, there’s a way to get the job done—it just might not be the same way as in the US—so being flexible with methodologies is important. I was once doing online bulletin boards in the US with women and teens on their face care routines—and in India, it turned out we had to do paper diaries. The research team in India had to hand-deliver each diary and then come back to the respondents’ homes to pick up the diaries a week later. It had been a while since I had even thought of paper diaries, but the results were just as rich and insightful!\\n\\n\\nIs your 60-minute interview really 60 minutes?\\n\\n\\nThe length of the interview is another consideration that often gets overlooked. What might be a 60-minute interview in the US is likely to last longer in other countries—just by nature of the other languages. Consider a standard introduction in English and how much longer those same words are when translated into German.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHi, my name is Paula and I work for a company called Escalent. We’re an independent market research company, which means that I am not trying to sell you anything, but it is my job to listen to your opinions, so I hope you will feel free to be open and honest and tell me what you really think.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHallo, mein Name ist Paula und ich arbeite für ein Unternehmen namens Escalent. Wir sind ein unabhängiges Marktforschungsunternehmen, was bedeutet, dass ich nicht versuche, Ihnen etwas zu verkaufen, aber es ist meine Aufgabe, Ihre Meinungen zu hören. Ich hoffe, Sie werden sich offen und ehrlich fühlen und mir sagen, was Sie wirklich tun denken.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s the same number of words, but you can see the words and phrases are longer. If you carry that through an entire discussion guide, your interview is going to run 15% longer, so you need to start with a shorter guide.\\n\\n\\nGerman may have extra-long words, but how interviews progress in other markets may also factor into the length of an interview. For example, building rapport in LATAM countries is a slower process—the intro and chit-chat tend to last a lot longer than they would in a US interview. And that’s not an area where you can shortchange a discussion, because we all know how critical it is to build rapport in qualitative research to generate meaningful insights. And thoughtful pauses in speaking are common in Japan, which can add time to an interview as well.\\n\\n\\nA good rule of thumb is to assume that your guide in English should be about 50 minutes long for a 60-minute interview in a non-English-speaking country.\\n\\n\\nRespecting scheduling norms is important\\n\\n\\nWhen research sessions take place is another area where things can be very different outside of the US. While there are certainly non-US countries where respondents are willing to miss a few hours of work to attend a market research session, there are others where that just isn’t the norm. In Japan, for example, unless your target respondents are retired, then all sessions must be conducted in the evening or over the weekend because working respondents are not willing to miss work to participate in market research. Fieldwork (and traveling to view fieldwork) needs to take that into consideration.\\n\\n\\nAnd the weekend isn’t even the same in every market. While the “standard” Monday-to-Friday workweek is pretty consistent throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia, in some Arab countries the weekend is Thursday and Friday and a standard workweek is Saturday to Wednesday. A few years ago, other Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE decided to shift their weekend to be a little more in-line with the Western world’s, and their weekend is now Friday and Saturday.\\n\\n\\nAlso, the long facility days that US moderators often are willing to put in aren’t the norm in many other countries. You are going to be hard-pressed to conduct more than two focus groups or 7–8 IDIs in a single day in OUS markets.\\n\\n\\nWhere are the M&Ms and one-way mirrors?\\n\\n\\nMarket research facilities are another area where things don’t always look the way they might in the US.\\n\\n\\nFor example, “typical” market research facilities with viewing rooms and one-way mirrors aren’t common in India—research often takes place in a hotel meeting room or rented rooms in an office building where viewers observe via closed circuit TV (CCTV).\\n\\n\\nOnce, while doing research with housewives in New Delhi, we held the research in an “apartment facility” where the women had their conversation in the living room and the clients and I were crammed into a spare bedroom watching via television. In some markets, like India, the research location isn’t determined until after the recruiting is finished to best accommodate the respondents, but that can leave US clients feeling ill-prepared for any travel. Working closely with your fieldwork partners in OUS markets to properly set expectations is crucial to ensure those viewing the research are prepared for the experience. In Mexico, if you want to speak to respondents in upper-socioeconomic levels, they may not be comfortable coming to a research facility—so qualitative research may be conducted in a well-known, high-end restaurant—and you’ll be viewing from another room via CCTV.\\n\\n\\nTo summarize, qualitative research outside of the US brings depth and insights into the global market for a product that can be invaluable. The trick is careful and flexible planning to ensure that the design and logistics are appropriate for each market. \\nSend us a note\\n if you have any questions, and good luck!'}\n","{'Index': 124, 'Heading': 'Tips for Translating Research Data Into a Story', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/tips-for-translating-research-data-into-a-story/', 'Content': 'Storytelling has been abuzz in the business sector for a while now and \\nbig names\\n are embracing the importance of honing these skills among their executives. There is an evolution under way for how to deliver insight, and with it comes a higher expectation for captivating storytelling as a vessel for delivering research insights.\\n\\n\\nStories can provide both stopping power and staying power with the ability to get people to sit up and listen as well as a \\nbetter understanding and a higher likelihood of being memorable\\n. A \\ngreat\\n story can convey something powerful in a really concise way, helping people with increasingly busy schedules and competing priorities focus on and connect to the insights quickly and with impact—something I’m calling a “compact story” or what you might think of as the executive summary, key findings or elevator pitch.\\n\\n\\nHuman beings are already primed to do this, people are communicating and consuming news in sound bites and tweets. Last year, \\nsocial media outpaced print newspapers in the US as a news source\\n.\\n\\n\\nYour Audience Expects a Story\\n\\n\\nThe expectation is there, so why is it so hard for many of us to live up to it? Well, great storytelling principles often fight against some of our natural instincts as researchers. For example, researchers need to have a keen eye for detail and need to dig in and know the data or interviews like the back of our hand… but in storytelling, these qualities put us “too in the weeds,” leading researchers to provide too many juicy data details instead of distilling them.\\n\\n\\nResearchers are programmed to seek answers but not necessarily trained on how to effectively share them. I think of it like that class many took in undergrad, “English for non-English majors”—we need to learn how to tell a great story despite coming from a variety of non-writing backgrounds.\\n\\n\\nTo get to a great, compact story, you have to both go low (dig deep) and go high (elevate the findings).\\n\\n\\nDig Deep: Repurpose a Familiar Research Staple\\n—\\nModerating\\n\\n\\nModerators tend to be great storytellers—it’s their job to push for the “why” and “so what,” to probe respondents until a fuller picture emerges. This is the same thing we need to do with our data, findings and insights—both quantitatively and qualitatively. If you think of each piece of data as a response that needs to be laddered up to a core business objective, you will start down a path that begins to resemble storytelling. For every key data point, ask why. When you understand why, ask what does this mean.\\n\\n\\nConsider a simple example. Let’s say your business objective is to understand how to get customers to buy more pens. First, you must understand the current pen-buying situation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour data say that 50% of all customers are buying pens today. So, you ask, “Why not 100%?”\\n\\n\\nYou wonder, “What is different between the group that buys pens and the group that doesn’t? Are some types of customers more likely than others to buy pens?” \\n\\n\\nThen you cut the data by those buying vs. those not buying pens and discover that those who buy pens are 40- to 65-year-olds and that 18- to 39-year-olds aren’t buying pens at all! \\n\\n\\nYou ponder, “Hmm, what is it about those 40- to 65-year-old folks that makes them more likely to buy pens?”\\n\\n\\nMore digging ensues—you ask yourself, “Who are these people? What else makes them different?”\\n\\n\\nDig, dig, dig, you see that 40- to 65-year-olds rely less on a smartphone compared to younger customers. “Well that makes sense,” you think. \\n\\n\\nYou push a little harder there, in the younger customers’ open-ends. They tell you they’re faster at typing than writing by hand. Ah-ha, they don’t see a need for pens. You need to help your client understand how to position pens for the younger generation!\\n\\n\\nSo, does this mean 40- to 65-year-olds don’t use smartphones, they just use pens? Probably not.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou learn that many in this age cohort also own smartphones \\nand\\n buy pens “Why only in this age group do customers both use smartphones and buy pens?”\\n\\n\\nTheir open-ends reveal that they find handwriting to be nostalgic and more natural and provide a human touch. This helps explain their difference in purchase behavior despite some similarities (smartphone use) with the younger group.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRinse and repeat for your next key finding. Of course, this is a silly, oversimplified example, but this probing technique can help ensure you’re squeezing every last drop of context and insight possible before building your recommendations.\\n\\n\\nElevate Findings: Complete Context ≠ Completely Dense\\n\\n\\nEveryone has their own style of writing reports, but one thing to consider when landing on your own approach is the way that people digest information these days. Few take the time to leisurely read news articles at the breakfast table anymore; tweets and news feeds satisfy the instant gratification that our fast-paced society craves. The same idea should be applied to your market research storytelling. I often hear, “let’s put the key findings at the back of the report so they have to listen to the rest before we give them what they want.” But why can’t we have both? A news-feed-like summary can whet their appetite and also act as a guide as your story unfolds with more context in the pages to follow.\\n\\n\\nUsing the example above:\\n\\n\\nToo dense:\\n \\nFifty percent of customers are buying pens today, with 75% of customers 40 to 65 years old purchasing pens versus 25% of customers 18\\xa0 to 39 years old. Customers 18 to 39 years old are also significantly more likely than older customers to own a smartphone (90% vs. 67%, respectively) and report that they are unlikely to buy pens because they are faster at typing than writing, unaided. \\n\\n\\nWe’ve all read (and written) findings like that, right? And then had to reread them a couple of times to figure out what all that text is trying to say.\\n\\n\\nElevated:\\n \\n18- to 39-year-olds are less likely to buy pens, citing efficiency of typing over handwriting.\\n\\n\\nThe latter text doesn’t provide every proof point, but it does provide the necessary information to understand the finding.\\n\\n\\nBeware of Pitfalls\\n\\n\\nIt can be helpful to recognize some common mistakes when trying to tell a story with market research findings:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing left-brain processes for a right-brain task\\n. There is no right approach or step-by-step process to craft a story—your creative process looks a little different and that’s OK. In this case, it’s the outcome that counts, not how you get there.\\n\\n\\nGetting bogged down with details. \\nIt’s tempting to quote each data point or respondent quote especially after spending so much time “in the weeds” understanding it. There is a place for these proof points, but it’s not in your story—it’s in the supporting points, or better yet, in detailed findings.\\n\\n\\nLack of context\\n. The best use of a researcher’s curiosity in storytelling is to ask “why” even when you’ve answered the “what.” Anticipating the questions readers will have is critical to telling a complete story.\\n\\n\\nLeaving your audience hanging.\\n Every story must have an ending. When we deliver something that doesn’t provide a “so what,” we haven’t ended the story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPull It All Together\\n\\n\\nOnce you have a deep understanding of the whys behind your whats, you have to establish a narrative to deliver your insights—arranging the key finding “tweets” into a story flow. To borrow another qualitative technique, I think of this step like a card-sort or Frankenstein exercise. If you have all of your key findings laid out in front of you, what order makes the most sense? What parts fit together and what parts may be missing? Even better is to pair your findings with evocative visuals and the respondent’s voice—but that’s a different topic for another blog! Until then, keeping these tips in mind may help you tell a compelling story next time around!

All local team members here in our Michigan-based headquarters boarded charter buses and headed to the beautiful Port of Detroit Waterview Loft for a celebration in a rejuvenated downtown Detroit. I sat quietly in my seat against the window, giving me an opportunity to peer out at the world and separate myself for a couple hours from the research back on my desk.\\n\\n\\nI couldn’t turn it off, though.\\xa0Riding along the highway, I found myself looking down on the vehicles below, passing our bus on their way. As a moderator and a proponent of observational research, I discovered an ideal tool for observing in-vehicle behavior—I could see down into passenger vehicles from my perch on high, one after the next, and my questions started multiplying.\\n\\n\\nI was surprised by how many people were driving in their cars alone and yet two cup holders were filled. And often with bottles and mugs and cups—not necessarily other stuff. Could that many people not be cleaning out their cars of old drinks? Are Americans just severely dehydrated?\\xa0If there was a third cup holder, would it also get used?\\n\\n\\nMore than half of those drivers were on their phone and I was surprised by how many people balanced them on their legs or laps. They clearly have a need to put their phones in a useful position, were not using hands-free options, and didn’t invest in another phone-holding or cradling device. Is there a more simple alternative to hands-free (like Velcro on their pants!?).\\n\\n\\nPlastic grocery bags are a more common mechanism for transporting stuff than I realized. It seemed like most drivers have a grocery bag in the passenger seat. What was in those bags and why do they sit there unsecured in the cabin? So many of those seats were filled with stuff. Do we need to design a passenger seat to hold something other than a passenger most of the time? How will we translate people’s car clutter into intelligence on user experience, such as maximizing storage and ease of access to what people carry in their vehicles?\\n\\n\\nAnd as fully autonomous vehicles inch nearer to reality, how will we adapt driver and passenger seats to user behaviors? When vehicles are entirely self-driving, could seats become more like rocking chairs or convert into beds, as we see on airplanes?\\n\\n\\nMy curiosity was piqued and I had to dig a bit deeper. Turning to our Escalent Automotive Consumer Pulse Study, an online survey* conducted monthly among approximately 1,000 US adults 18 years of age and older, I asked a couple of questions to find out how often vehicle owners use passenger seats and for what. It turns out, over 90% at least sometimes place items in the seat when the front passenger seat is not occupied by a person. And nearly one third \\nalways\\n place things in the passenger seat. What do they put in the passenger seat? Common items include backpacks, purses or wallets, food or groceries, laptops or briefcases, bags, cellphones, and clothes.\\n\\n\\nI certainly witnessed this from my perch in the charter bus. I saw a lot of vehicles in a short time-frame and I found myself thinking later that I should have been snapping photos of each one along the way—although, maybe that was a bad idea and a bit invasive! My bus seat high above the traffic was a point of view I’d never considered before and now I’m eager to find a way to turn this experience into more learning.\\n\\n\\nCheck out our AV Report\\n\\n\\nOur team dug into how automotive and mobility companies can encourage autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption amid consumers who fear self-driving technologies.

Solving a Parking Problem with a Data-Driven Approach', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/park-it-solving-a-parking-problem-with-a-data-driven-approach/', 'Content': 'I was honored to represent Escalent this March at the 2019 \\nWayne State University Big Data & Business Analytics Summit\\n, sharing a case study about the development of our \\nDataDialogue™|Park concept\\n.\\n\\n\\nSome of the best and brightest analytics minds from metro Detroit, and beyond, came together for two days of sharing and learning around Big Data at the WSU Summit. It’s amazing to see how the conversation around Big Data has transformed in even just the few short years I’ve been attending this event. We’ve come so far from asking: “Is Big Data the hope or hype?”\\n\\n\\nOur breakout session took the DataDialogue|Park content from \\nour award-winning Geotab Data Challenge entry\\n – a concept to help commercial truck drivers easily find safe and convenient parking – and applied a twist. I presented the development process through the lens of a business framework for data-driven problem solving.\\n\\n\\nThere are three questions to ask when considering a data-driven problem solving approach:\\n\\n\\n1. What is the business problem?\\n\\n\\nWe all go through this process daily, whether we realize it or not. We identify and define problems – whether at work, in our personal lives, or watching and reading the news. We all know there’s plenty of problems in the news…but I digress. The key is to focus narrowly on a business problem, and understand if the problem is worth investing time and money in:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs the problem \\nimportant\\n?\\n\\n\\nIs it \\nvaluable\\n?\\n\\n\\nAnd do we \\nknow the\\n \\ndesired outcome\\n?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt didn’t require much digging to recognize the importance of the commercial truck parking problem, with statistics everywhere. In July 2018, I moved my mother back from Arizona to Michigan in a U-Haul. I lost track of how many tractor trailers were parked along entrance and exit ramps, or even alongside the interstates! Perhaps most enlightening for me is government involvement. In 2012, the federal government enacted Jason’s Law in honor of a driver who was shot and killed in 2009, after parking in an unsafe location. The law mandates the U.S. Department of Transportation to regularly review truck parking.\\n\\n\\nThe value of addressing this challenge is extensive. Not only is time spent looking for parking a non-revenue activity, it could actually cost the company with potential hours of service (HoS) violations and fines. Furthermore, a solution can help increase driver retention – which is a valuable ROI in an age where the driver shortage is publicized regularly.\\n\\n\\nTo address this challenge requires a concept developed through the lens of providing the driver with actionable information to find safe and convenient parking, whether by search function or automated notification. We did this by creating the Parking Favorability Score, which presents the driver with a rank-order of recommended parking locations.\\n\\n\\n2. What data are available?\\n\\n\\nStatistics vary, however, the majority of time solving data problems is spent in data discovery. The term discovery is a bit of a misnomer, as it encompasses so much more than just finding the data to use. Finding the data is just the tip of the iceberg. Anyone who has worked with data knows there is no such thing as that “perfect” dataset.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere do we \\nfind data\\n?\\n\\n\\nHow do we \\naccess them\\n?\\n\\n\\nWhat is the \\ndata\\n \\nmanagement plan\\n?\\n\\n\\nDo we need to \\nclean or transform it\\n?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor us, this part was easy, relatively-speaking. We were provided access to publicly available datasets as part of the \\n2018 Geotab Data Challenge\\n. The concept was a one-time use case, so we downloaded the data we needed to fit our concept. Then, we went to work transforming and aggregating the raw data into our Parking Favorability Score.\\n\\n\\nIn most cases, the analyst has to scour many different sources, some even behind pay walls. That said, sources are proliferating by the day with indexed contents like this one on \\nGitHub\\n, or searchable sets like \\ndata.gov\\n or \\nGoogle\\n. Once the source is identified, one can simply download the data as we did, or opt for a more sustainable approach with eyes to productization. Doing so requires coding an application programming interface (API) – in essence, a pipeline between desired endpoints that signals to pull selected data from the source to your ecosystem on a defined cadence.\\n\\n\\nLastly, the answer is yes. Yes, in nearly all cases, you will need to transform your data in some fashion or another to make it useful. In this space, I will “plead the fifth” on the specifics of what and how we took raw data to create the Parking Favorability Score. There’s no short path to explaining it. \\nEmail me\\n if you would like to discuss or learn more\\n.\\n\\n\\n3. How do we use analytics to solve the problem?\\n\\n\\nIf you have made it this far in the problem-solving process, you are further along than most data initiatives. Pat yourself on the back for that. But your work is not done. Now, you need to determine what analytical approaches are needed, as well as how to deliver the analytics to solve the problem. At least for us data-and-analytics-nerds, this part is fun. As a best practice, you’ll want to embrace an iterative, scalable development process for the analytics deliverable. Think: “Good. Better. Best.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat investment is required to deliver minimum acceptable value – define your \\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP)\\n? Side note: this will require research!\\n\\n\\nHow can it be \\nextended to deliver incremental value\\n?\\n\\n\\nAnd, ultimately, what is the \\noptimal solution\\n?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe biggest challenge here is embracing, and ultimately staying true to, an iterative development mindset. This is essentially a distilled version of \\ndesign thinking\\n: creation of a concept MVP guided by understanding target user pain points, test with users, iterate and refine, further test with users, iterate and refine, etc. This approach helps lead you to a customer-centric solution.\\n\\n\\nFor the MVP, we assumed that when a search function around a ZIP code is engaged by a driver, they are intent on finding parking. We assumed a limited search radius (ex: 10 miles) and provided scored parking in that area. This works similar to Google Maps when your GPS is turned off. For “good,” we went a step further, integrating GPS-based data so we know where the driver is and provide parking in a radius around that location. This is like Google Maps when your phone location is turned on. A “better” solution was to layer on HoS data – knowing what time a driver needs to park by allows us to conservatively estimate the location and recommend parking for that area. Finally, the “best” approach is to integrate GPS, HoS, and fleet dispatch data – knowing the final destination for the driver, we can predict if they reach their destination before or after their HoS clock runs out, and recommend parking appropriately for the situation.\\n\\n\\nThere are always opportunities to improve concepts as more data becomes available to the system, or new approaches are envisioned. For example, there is incremental data we could consider like new parking locations, updated parking infrastructure data, or even driver feedback on parking areas. Additionally, there is expanded functionality that can be enabled, such as the ability to customize the analysis radius preference or, going a step further, providing push notifications as opposed to only search-based results.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to know more about our DataDialogue|Park Parking Favorability Score concept or want to talk about this data-driven problem-solving framework, click below to send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 127, 'Heading': 'The Power, and Pitfalls, of Politicizing Your Brand', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/the-power-and-pitfalls-of-politicizing-your-brand/', 'Content': 'There was once a time when even the most provocative brands may have sat on their hands and remained silent on hot-button political and societal issues. However, in today’s modern, globally connected landscape, the pervasiveness of social media has made this kind of discourse a necessary part of the conversation for brands.\\n\\n\\nIt’s easy to see why. \\nExamples such as Nike’s 30th anniversary campaign starring Colin Kaepernick\\n have shown the power of harnessing a political stance to thrust your brand’s message into the public spotlight.\\n\\n\\nBut brands don’t always get it right. Recent high-profile missteps from Dove and Gillette have shown the uproar that occur when brands attempt to piggyback powerful political discord.\\n\\n\\nSo, what do brands need to understand when politics come into play?\\n\\n\\nKnow your history\\n\\n\\nOne of the keys to successfully pulling off a politically charged brand message is to really understand the historical politics at play. It may sound simple, but often organizations’ best intentions are undone by a simple lack of clarity around the conversation they are attempting to partake in.\\n\\n\\nDove apologized recently following a particularly tone-deaf version of an ad that appeared on the company’s Facebook page. The online campaign showed a black woman removing her top to reveal a white woman underneath, a clip that was a shortened version of a 30-second TV spot that includes more than seven women of different ethnicities and ages. The aim, which comes across loud and clear on the TV spot, was to use the women’s differences to highlight the fact that all skin deserves gentleness. Sadly, that message was lost in translation in the online clip.\\n\\n\\nThe connotations of the ad instantly drew negativity and led social media users \\nto draw parallels with racist soap adverts that were prominent in the turn of the 20th century.\\n\\n\\nThe three-second clip turned into a long-running nightmare for the brand, and Dove was forced to remove the ad and apologize after the social media outcry started to dominate the news cycle.\\n\\n\\nIn a \\ntweet\\n the brand explained, “An image we recently posted on Facebook missed the mark in representing women of color thoughtfully. We deeply regret the offense it caused.”\\n\\n\\nBut despite Dove’s apology, the damage was done. The social media backlash against the company continued, with many users calling for the public to boycott the brand. Indeed, the hashtag #BoycottDove was quickly trending at the same time media outlets were devoting thousands of column inches to the scandal.\\n\\n\\nClarity is key\\n\\n\\nWhile Dove’s misstep showcases the danger of getting it wrong, a recent campaign from Gillette has demonstrated the potential pitfalls of failing to say anything at all.\\n\\n\\nGillette’s recent ad revised its famous slogan, calling out toxic masculinity to ask customers, “Is this the best a man can get?” A deliberate attempt to enter the conversation surrounding the #MeToo movement, the company explained on its \\nwebsite\\n, “It’s time we acknowledge that brands, like ours, play a role in influencing culture. And\\xa0as a company that encourages men to be their best, we have a responsibility to make sure we are promoting positive, attainable, inclusive and healthy versions of what it means to be a man.”\\n\\n\\nIt’s an honorable sentiment. But the problem is that while Gillette’s intentions may have been good, the company stopped short of actually making a statement on the issue. Instead it felt like the company was merely piggybacking a current social issue rather than actually attempting to affect any kind of positive change. As a result, Gillette alienated both its customer base and the public at large. Indeed, the ad hit front pages across the globe and brewed a social media storm in the process.\\n\\n\\nThe \\nYouTube\\n video of the advert, which has been viewed over 30 million times, offers a snapshot of the reception the brand received. To date, it has received 1.4 million “dislikes” and over 400,000 comments, mostly negative.\\n\\n\\nManaging backlash\\n\\n\\nOne key thing that brands need to consider if they are going to take this approach, is that their statement is going to make a splash no matter what. You can’t please everyone, especially in the partisan world of social media. So, it can sometimes be difficult to decide how you should respond to any negative conversation surrounding your campaign.\\n\\n\\nDo you clarify, apologize or double down on your message? A lot depends on your original intent—after all, if you missed something, your approach would differ dramatically from the one you’d take if you had intended to make a statement.\\n\\n\\nNike’s “Take a Knee” campaign, for example, caused outcry from figures such as President Trump and spurred viral videos of fans destroying the company’s products. Nike never apologized for its approach, however, and despite the backlash, saw sales increase by more than 31% after the campaign went live.\\n\\n\\nNike’s success, alongside the missteps of Dove and Gillette, provides a lesson for brands that want to engage in this arena: the value of being able to quantify the impact of negative coverage. Without understanding how the discussion might impact your brand’s health, it is impossible for decision-makers to get ahead of the issues.\\n\\n\\nAt Escalent, we are often asked, “Does negative press coverage really impact our brand health? And if so, can we quantify that impact?” Our \\nTechnology\\n team conducted self-funded study to answer these questions, revealing the real impact of negative press coverage for some of the most prominent companies today.\\n\\n\\nClick below to download our white paper for the results of our study.'}\n","{'Index': 128, 'Heading': 'Are We Asking The Right Questions About Electric Vehicle Adoption?', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/are-we-asking-the-right-questions-about-electric-vehicle-adoption/', 'Content': 'I love asking questions. Being a moderator, it is literally what I do for a living. But like a musical artist who dislikes her most popular \\nsongs\\n, the shine of some questions have become dull and over-played. \\xa0One such question is the ever so popular, “why aren’t people adopting electric vehicles (EV)?” It is not that this is a bad question, but it has already been answered, repeatedly. \\xa0When I searched, “why aren’t people buying electric vehicles,” I received over 100 million results. The top few articles to emerge (yes, a few out of 100 million results, so take my sample size with a grain of salt) discuss some key reasons that people are not adopting electric vehicles, including:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRange anxiety\\n\\n\\nCost of entry\\n\\n\\nLack of infrastructure\\n\\n\\nLack of models for different lifestyles & life stages\\n\\n\\nMiseducation about EV\\n\\n\\nLack of dealer knowledge and support\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo why continue to ask this question if it has been answered ad nauseam? My guess is that some believe that their specific target is “different.” From my sample size of 1 moderator, I can tell you that while the order of these issues may be rearranged for different target groups, the same reasons are regurgitated back to me group after group. So I propose we start asking better questions – one of which would be:\\n\\n\\n“Given all of these aforementioned issues,\\n\\nhow do I sell an EV to you now?”\\n\\n\\nIn my opinion, this is a better question to ask and here’s why.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n1: It acknowledges that there are issues with electric vehicle adoption\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmong those 100 million articles, there are some articles (again, sample size of a few) that wax poetic about “if people would just try it, they would like it.” While the results seem interesting for this type of \\nresearch\\n, I wonder if this is enough for widespread adoption for a high-risk investment product such as vehicles. Today, consumers borrow an average of \\n$30,500 to purchase a new vehicle.\\n That is a large risk to try something that does not meet a person’s needs.\\n\\n\\nThe other issue I see with the “if they try it, they will come” philosophy is that trials are finite. When I have conducted EV research, some people always bring up the “what if” factor. What if I want to be spontaneous but can’t because I have to wait to charge? What if I run out of charge, particularly if I’m with my kids or an elderly relative? Worse yet: what if the car runs out of charge when my kid is driving alone? \\xa0Although some clients poo-poo these hesitations, to truly understand what it may take to get someone into an electric vehicle, one must empathize with the fact that this purchase is seen as a large leap of faith that must clear many hurdles, including the “what ifs.” And from my moderating experiences, I know that once people feel that you \\ndo\\n empathize with their concerns, the conversations yield better insights.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n2: It has longevity\\n\\n\\nAlthough some of today’s barriers, such as widespread adoption, may be breached in the coming years, some concerns may just dissolve into new ones. With \\n12 million electric vehicles\\n slated to be on the road globally in 2025, predictions are that some countries’ infrastructure may not be ready to handle the expected demand. In the U.S. alone, the \\nInternational Council on Clean Transportation (icct)\\n suggests that 3 million EVs will be on the road in 2025. However, the icct analysis indicates that charging infrastructure will need to increase 20% \\nper year\\n to meet that demand. Although steps to increase infrastructure are deemed “promising” by icct, the analysis also indicates that there is still work to be done. This may come as a shock to some as the perceived golden age of EV infrastructure may be further out than anticipated. As such, the question of “how do I sell an EV to you now?” will still be relevant as the market, and its barriers, evolve.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n3: It creates the foundation for a longer term marketing strategy of EVs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough the influx of electric vehicles will give customers more choices, it will also come at the tune of a global oversupply of \\n14 million vehicles by 2030, according to Deloitte\\n.\\n\\n\\nCompetition will be fierce and the spoils will go to those who have a clear understanding of their customers, with Deloitte suggesting:\\n\\n\\n“[t]hose that can successfully build trust in their brand, ensure a positive customer experience from initial sale through to aftercare, and reflect consumer shifts towards the sharing economy in future business models will successfully navigate this.”\\n\\n\\nBut how does one build trust and positive experiences if one is not asking more fruitful questions today? Knowing how to court consumers when there are numerous hurdles – real or perceived – to EV adoption will lay a solid foundation of understanding of what types of marketing messages, channels, and experiences work in the EV space before the market is saturated with options.\\n\\n\\nAsking the hard questions now may seem daunting. Like a favorite song played on repeat, it is simpler to continue to ask the same questions because we already \\nknow \\nwhat to expect. But asking different and, potentially, more difficult questions is always advantageous as it usually provides more insightful responses that yield a larger set of viable solutions. And why I provided one such question that may spark better conversations with consumers, I am sure there are others that can be asked that will be more fruitful than a question that has already been answered over 100 million times.\\n\\n\\nIf you’d like to learn more about research design and how to ensure you’re asking the right questions, click below to send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 129, 'Heading': 'AI and Market Research: Compatible or Combustible?', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/ai-and-market-research-compatible-or-combustible/', 'Content': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly been in the news as a technology that will radically change the world around us. Autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants and medical diagnostic systems are just some AI-based services that will alter how we live. However, whether the impact of these changes will all be positive is an open question. To that point, some individuals focus on the efficiencies and insights that AI will produce, while others are more concerned with a loss of control, a vulnerability to meddling and the loss of jobs that might result.\\n\\n\\nWith the potential ramifications AI presents across all industries and fields, what are the implications for market research? Specifically, will AI serve as a competitor and undermine the need for specific research services and tasks? Or will AI serve as a powerful complement to market research and enable enhanced services and insight?\\n\\n\\nThe most likely answer is both. Some research is likely to decline as organizations start to fully pursue AI initiatives. However, in other cases, AI is expected to create new opportunities by providing greater focus and additional options to leverage.\\n\\n\\nMarket Research Still Has a Role to Play\\n\\n\\nDespite the impressive range of new capabilities and insights offered by AI, it is not all-powerful or infallible. As a result, market researchers would be wise to both:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunderstand the current limitations of AI and the role that market research can continue to play in filling client needs, and\\n\\n\\nrecognize the genuine advancements that AI is making in business analysis and then enhance and extend these new insights through focused, in-depth market research initiatives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI Constraints Are Real\\n\\n\\nThere are several reasons AI is not an existential threat to traditional market research, and they relate to some of AI’s current constraints and limitations:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Fragile” systems:\\xa0\\nAI is only as good as the trainers and/or the data that are used to train the models. Deep learning models, the most advanced form of AI, are able to train themselves but only through exposure to a huge amount of data. If the initial construction of models is not robust enough or there is insufficient or incomplete data to adequately train the deep learning models, AI inaccuracies will result. The Wall Street Journal article “\\nWho Comes to the Rescue of Stranded Robots? Humans\\n” speaks to the fragility of AI systems by chronicling how humans have needed to “rescue” autonomous food-delivery robots found stuck in gardens and snowbanks.\\n\\n\\nAI models as a “black box”:\\xa0\\nOne significant problem with AI models is that it is often difficult to understand the “why” behind the model. Even those algorithms programmed by humans can be difficult to follow. In turn, algorithms and the underlying logic behind the answers produced by deep learning systems can be unfathomable. This makes it difficult to determine what the key drivers of a decision might be or how to troubleshoot output that may not be sufficiently accurate. Most important, many find it difficult to have confidence in output from a “black box” they don’t understand.\\n\\n\\nResource constraints:\\xa0\\nData scientists are highly trained professionals and are in high demand. In addition, the development of algorithms and the training process can be intensive both in terms of labor hours and computer processing equipment/capabilities required. Given that AI is frequently resource-intensive, it is unlikely to be a practical solution for addressing all business questions and decision-making.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI Will Increasingly Influence Marketing Decision-making\\n\\n\\nHowever, it is clear that AI is a powerful tool that will play a huge role in optimizing business operations and marketing decision-making. As an example, many organizations want to use AI to better understand and use the vast amount of data they already generate and own. By processing and analyzing these data, AI is able to identify key variables and important relationships between these variables that might otherwise go unrecognized. AI is also able to predict certain behaviors by determining how these and other variables will likely impact decisions. Therefore, AI will increasingly be used by marketers to evaluate different options to determine which will produce the best outcomes.\\n\\n\\nThe Ability to Leverage AI Insights Is Also Real\\n\\n\\nRather than worry about the negative impacts of AI on market research, a better approach might be to focus on the ways that market research can leverage and benefit from AI. As AI applications develop and evolve, so too will market research opportunities that leverage AI findings and insights. A few such ways might include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDigging into the “what”:\\n\\xa0Using AI’s evaluation of social media and other customer feedback systems, market research can further probe the themes, messages and needs identified by AI, as well as explore new product ideas, pricing, promotion and distribution ideas developed in response to these insights.\\n\\n\\nExamining the “who”:\\xa0\\nAs AI defines different consumer segments and high-potential prospective customers, market research can conduct additional in-depth research to gain a more complete profile of how these individuals think, feel and act.\\n\\n\\nExplaining the “why”:\\xa0\\nWhile AI identifies key trends and relationships that predict consumer behavior, market research can work in concert to more fully explore what is driving a particular trend, determine the rationale behind key triggers, and understand how key influences come into play.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI will clearly advance the ability of organizations and their marketing departments to better understand their markets and key factors for success. At the same time, market research can and will play a critical role in building on this understanding to create even greater and more extensive insights. It is in this way that market researchers will continue to add value in the era of AI.'}\n","{'Index': 130, 'Heading': 'Why the EV Work Truck is Here to Stay', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/why-the-ev-work-truck-is-here-to-stay/', 'Content': 'For more than two decades, the National \\nWork Truck Show\\n has been where commercial trucking business gets done. Invariably, deals made on the floor of this expo result in the placement of thousands of new big rigs on America’s roadways.\\n\\n\\nTough. Dependable. Job done.\\n\\n\\nAt this year’s show, however, I noticed a perceptible shift in the winds, heralding a greener future. Discussed for years, but considered the costly stuff of fancy imagination and drawing boards, EV trucking has made its grand entry into the trucking consciousness, and a new trio of current-time buzzwords were being uttered by attendees of this year’s show:\\n\\n\\nAutonomy. Connectivity. Electrification.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, the biggest headlines at the \\nNTEA\\n’s annual showcase weren’t about torque, hauling capacity, and power. In fact, the news that had everyone buzzing was the opinions of some experts that, by 2022, the cost of owning an EV truck, over its lifetime, will equal that of its gas or diesel-sipping counterparts.\\n\\n\\nLet that sink in for a moment. It cannot be understated that, in a room full of people who depend upon box trucks to tractor-trailers for their livelihoods, no less than some of the industry’s biggest advocates pronounced that their entire business model is about to be forever transformed.\\n\\n\\n“Electrification can be really beneficial for the work truck environment,” said Michael Berube, a U.S. Department of Energy executive and presenter at the show. “I know we’re in the early days, but the time is now for people to get in and start experimenting, because it’s going to be the wave of the future.”\\n\\n\\nPresenters like Berube aren’t just thinking about catching the latest wave in technology – they are also considering the positive environmental impact of the work truck industry shifting to EV powertrains as millions of hybrid and EV passenger cars emit infinitesimal amounts of carbons into our atmosphere. In fact, the \\nNational Energy Agency found\\n that emissions for heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) have grown faster than any other transit mode – by a national average of 2.6 percent – since 2000.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhat will it take for work trucks to dive into the EV pool?\\n\\n\\nClearly, despite the headline-making benefits of EV, the market reality is thus: Few manufacturers are poised to deliver fleets of electrified rigs. It will take more than the \\nTesla Semi\\n – a fully electrified tractor-trailer scheduled to hit highways in 2020 – to turn a whimper into a bang.\\n\\n\\nFortunately, more traditional rivals have taken notice. \\nDaimler\\n, the world’s largest truck manufacturer, is already \\nproducing electric rigs\\n under its various brands. Last June, they \\nunveiled two electric Freightliner trucks\\n – the eCascadia and medium-duty eM2 106 – which they confirm are poised for production in 2021. More recently, in late March of 2019, Tesla rival \\nNikola Motors announced\\n it was building a manufacturing facility for its hydrogen-electric rig on 400 acres of land it purchased in Arizona. Finally, \\nFord signaled their EV intentions\\n, announcing the evolution of their eTrucking plans at the Work Truck Show.\\n\\n\\nHowever, with these few exceptions, the work truck industry remains woefully unprepared for this phase shift. Most companies simply aren’t ready to take advantage of this change, or haven’t felt the pressure of increased demand from purchasers, to double-down on EV technology.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhy should the work truck industry embrace EV?\\n\\n\\nClearly, if we analyze the cost-to-operate statements made at the Work Truck Show, we can extrapolate that in about a half-decade, EV trucks will be cheaper to operate over their lifetime than fueled rigs. Understanding and marketing these benefits will likely help to move the needle.\\n\\n\\nGovernment entities, eager to reduce emissions, will likely insist that fleets start to make the transformation over time – so the burden may shift to fleet managers, who will look to embrace EV additions to their fleets sooner, rather than later.\\n\\n\\nThe European Union\\n and Chinese truck makers are forging ahead into electrification, understanding its environmental and economic importance. So it will be imperative for American manufacturers to keep pace and push the EV needle to remain competitive.\\n\\n\\nThe time is now to gain a greater understanding of the EV trucking business – definitely, clearly the risk for those who delay entry is great.\\n\\n\\nWant to gain a greater understanding of how electrification trends will impact your manufacturing operations?\\n We at Escalent are happy to help you gather insights to help you better embrace an EV trucking future.

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) – with their emission-free, high-torque benefits – have already become ubiquitous on the streets of the world’s largest cities.\\n\\n\\nInjected into the consciousness by Tesla, which made BEVs cool and sporty while boosting their range between charging cycles, BEVs are finding their way into the hands of a growing number of consumers. In 2018, more than \\n2.1 million new car buyers\\n around the world chose battery power – motivated by energy-consciousness, the cool factor, or simply being the early adopter for new technologies.\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, it’s still unclear who will be the target buyer for the new generation of BEVs. Though actor Tom Hanks once famously and proudly proclaimed that he drives a BEV “to save America,” such altruism is not universal, especially when it comes at a premium.\\n\\n\\nAlso, manufacturers are still rolling out BEVs that are “less than” – forcing compromises that some members of the car-buying public may feel are simply not worth it. Suffice it to say, finding the balance between actual driving needs and current BEV capabilities will be key to widespread adoption of BEVs.\\n\\n\\nAmong the questions that must be answered satisfactorily for the public to broadly accept BEVs into their lives:\\n\\n\\n1. What do I have to do differently to drive a BEV?\\n\\n\\nTesla aside, many of the current generation of BEVs have required compromises that aren’t always palatable to a public that is well served with current products. BEVs tend to have unusual, polarizing styling cues, and are small in stature, compromising passenger and cargo space for the sake of efficiency. Additionally, fully committing to a BEV means that drivers will have to refine their pedal-stomping, race-from-red driving habits to optimize the range on a charge.\\n\\n\\nManufacturers seem to be heeding the public’s desire for BEVs that blend in. Hyundai’s Kona crossover SUV and the remodeled Nissan Leaf have been styled in the ilk of more traditional offerings – and have been met with accolades as a result.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n2. Where do I plug in?\\n\\n\\nToday, there are more than 67,000 charging stations across the United States, with more opening daily. But there are 168,000 gas stations, which means drivers will likely have to cover significant ground to find a place to “charge up.” Though consumers will get the best charge via a dedicated, proprietary charging connection, many of today’s BEVs can be charged in a pinch (albeit slowly) through typical household current.\\n\\n\\nOf course, you \\ncan\\n install a fast charger in your own garage; the \\nnational average cost for installation\\n is around $1,200. For many, charging at home is one of the greatest benefits of having a BEV.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n3. How far can I drive on a full charge?\\n\\n\\nThough this has improved significantly, there’s still a way to go. GM’s first fully electrified vehicles, which hit roadways in the early 1990s, needed a charge every 70 to 80 miles – barely enough for the daily in-town grind, and certainly too stingy for road warriors. Today’s mass market BEVs can cover about 200 miles between plug-ins, and some newer products are even promising 400 miles.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n4. I can fill my gas tank in three minutes – why can’t I charge as fast?\\n\\n\\nCharging technologies, though improved, still haven’t leveled the playing field with fossil-fueled counterparts. The typical home charger can only muster a full charge every 6-8 hours; and fast chargers in the wild can cut that to just a couple of hours (Tesla’s Supercharger technology cuts the full-charging time to just 30 minutes). New battery-charging technologies are being tested that will reduce the charging time to 15 minutes, but it’s important to note that both battery and charging infrastructure will have to be modified to deliver the benefits.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n5. Will prices come down?\\n\\n\\nThis is a function of several factors – improved battery technology as well as government rebates and tax credits certainly will help, but consumer adoption will have the biggest downward pressure on price. It’s truly a chicken-and-egg paradigm – volume will ultimately drive discounts. Consider that the major manufacturers are spinning out millions of gas-powered cars each year – if BEV sales comprise only a small percentage of that total, you have to pass along more of the manufacturing and research charges to the consumer.\\n\\n\\nThat said, more than half of US BEV sales in 2018 were racked up by one car model – the Tesla Model 3. This car managed to double the market while only being out for half the year. What drove its sales success was its increased range – up to 300 miles on a charge – for a price, around $40,000, that was in the ballpark for most luxury sedan consumers.\\n\\n\\nAre you looking to better understand the wants and needs of the potential BEV-buying public?\\n We are continuing to do innovation research in electrification consumer wants, and always happy to help.

I found this to be particularly true recently during a groundbreaking study which, unintentionally, discovered the following: Drivers, when questioned about their driving habits, will invariably lie about their adherence to the law.\\n\\n\\nTo be fair – we don’t necessarily think the study participants intended to lie about their driving habits; instead, much the same way that an angler recalls their catch to be bigger than it actually was, these drivers tended to recall a better self-image of their doppelgangers behind the wheel.\\n\\nhttps://msu.edu/\\n\\nBut first, some context: This past winter, researchers from Escalent had the chance to partner with three very bright \\nMichigan State University\\n (MSU) students who were working towards their M.S. in Business Analytics. As part of their Capstone project, these students were required to work on a real-world, big data project prior to graduation.\\n\\n\\nWe saw a dual benefit to the students’ partnership – we were working on a project that required the analysis of a large amount of vehicle telematics data from both passenger and commercial vehicles, and we needed the help! But for these students – who will soon be on the job market – it was a valuable way to help them understand a mega-trend in employment.\\n\\n\\nAccording to the latest \\nGreenBook Research Industry Trend (GRIT) report\\n, companies are on the hunt for new skill sets to meet the demands of a rapidly changing marketplace. Further, the report found that data analysts and data scientists are in high demand. The MSU program is dedicated to preparing young talent for the future of connected devices, and for the future of mobility by partnering with companies who are also preparing for a new generation of consumer engagement and business models.\\n\\n\\nWith our team assembled, we set out to understand the relationship between self-reported driving behavior collected via an online survey, and observed driving behavior collected via an onboard telematics device.\\n\\n\\nAs researchers, we know there are limitations associated with every research project, and there is an array of reasons why participants don’t, or can’t, provide accurate responses.\\xa0 Of course, we design research projects to minimize limitations, but it is impossible to account for all factors that may influence research findings. As such, telematics offers a rare opportunity, through technology, to better understand the relationship between self-reported and directly measured behavioral data.\\n\\n\\nThrough the comparison of telematics data collected from 130 passenger vehicles against self-reported data collected from an online survey, the researchers and MSU students learned something surprising – the actual driving patterns of more than half (55 percent) of participants did not match their self-reported tendencies.\\n\\n\\nWhile we expected a degree of mismatch between the telematics and self-reported data, we, honestly, didn’t expected half the sample to be wrong. We also observed that men were more likely to misreport – both in stating they had an aggressive driving style but actually were passive, or self-reporting they were passive when they actually were aggressive.\\n\\n\\nWe don’t believe our participants intentionally lied. Instead, we believe that a case of “social desirability” bias – the tendency for people to over-report “good” behavior and under-report “bad” behavior – was at work here. Another explanation may be something called “compromise effect.” This is a result of the tendency to choose the middle option, rather than options on the extremes, when presented with choices. This also can happen when options are not clearly stated, or are vague. Though we believed we had provided three clearly-written descriptions of driving styles to choose from, and while we put considerable effort into crafting these descriptions, we perhaps didn’t entirely hit the mark.\\n\\n\\nSo what does this mean for survey research? While using data from a connected device – in our case, a vehicle – may not be possible for every research project, as an industry, we need to take advantage of enabling technologies that will allow us to better understand the extent of the gap between intended and actual behavior, where feasible or appropriate. I do not believe we will be able to forgo engaging with consumers to solely rely on passive data. But, we certainly can complement self-reported feedback with observed behavior for more confident business decisions.\\n\\n\\nIf we at Escalent can be of assistance to you in conducting this type of analysis, please click below to send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 134, 'Heading': 'Rise of the Smart Car: The Shape-Shifting Motoring Future is Already Here', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/rise-of-the-smart-car-the-shape-shifting-motoring-future-is-already-here/', 'Content': 'For fans of the Terminator series of movies, it was compelling to think about a world that would foster “The Rise of the Machines.”\\n\\n\\nFor consumers today – living in a switched-on world where the once-impossible is now a foregone conclusion – a profound, shape-shifting change is underway – one that we will call, “The Rise of the Smart Car.”\\n\\n\\nFor those who have experienced the “tip of the iceberg” innovations in today’s currently-available models, it’s easy to see how the continued evolution of automated features, connectedness and yet-to-be-scoped technology will portend a future that is not that far off.\\n\\n\\nAs we walked the floor of the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we gasped at the surreal experience before us. No longer did we see cars, as we, for generations, have come to experience them. Replacing the four wheels and a box were a dizzying array of form factors – designed more to contain, and define, a future driving experience where the exterior is not nearly as relevant as what lives inside. Changeable seats, in-car virtual reality, and holographic systems are among the newest innovations, jockeying to advance the traveling transformation underway.\\n\\n\\nAnother reality that quickly unfolded as we walked the CES: There’s not one universal standard for the smart cars of the future. And, likewise, there’s no universal agreement on what the future “device” should look like. Beyond agreeing that electrification, connectivity, shared mobility and autonomy are the foundation, there’s no unifying approach that would dictate things like how many screens are enough (or too much), what the interior should look like, or how pervasive these connected car systems should be during the driving experience.\\n\\n\\nThis makes it even more imperative that manufacturers, designers and others who earn their salt from the automotive industry, gain a keen understanding of where the motoring future is headed – and to embrace an ideal in which the car will be at the center of how we travel or experience seamless mobility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“The Car, As We Know It, Is Dead.”\\n\\n\\nThis change from what we have accepted as a “car,” is a movie that we’ve seen before (and, by this, we do not mean a Hollywood production). For the longest time, the phone was a clearly defined object – a box with 12 buttons, a handset and a cord. For generations, there was little debate as to what the phone should look like. Then, at some point, the cord was cut – and the world went crazy. No longer could we envision what the future of the phone would look like. Experimenters tried approaches that eliminated some – or all – of the telephone’s sacred cows – buttons, dials, handsets and cords.\\n\\n\\nToday, the device we hold – the smartphone – is the result of a tumultuous sea of change in the phone segment. And the “phone” itself – the enablement of point-to-point voice communication – is relegated to a single button on a screen with endless communication choices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo can we expect that, in similar fashion, the core function of the car – to deliver people and parcels from Point A to Point B – will simply be an item on a long list of what the “smartcar” of the future can do?\\n\\n\\nLet’s explore in more detail by looking at some themes that were emerging as we absorbed the CES.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMega Trends Are Alive and Well\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonalization – \\nThough we can program our favorite waypoints and radio stations in today’s vehicles, consumers – accustomed to downloading whatever apps they desire to their smartphones – will be demanding much greater personalization in the vehicle of the future. Customization of physical and sensory aspects (such as interior lighting and sound), connected services (both remote and in-vehicle), and virtual personal assistants that connect us to the car and to other devices, lead the list.\\n\\n\\nExperience – \\nAcquiring possessions is losing ground to the appreciation of an experience. In vehicles, this is manifesting itself by making driving less of the focus, while offering new functions with benefits, such as enhanced comfort, entertainment and productivity – many of which will be available “on demand” to the consumer, through subscription services.\\n\\n\\nSharing – \\nConsumers share more than ever before, both actively (e.g., Facebook) and passively (e.g., location-based apps). Vehicles are joining the fray as sharing becomes not only a common trend, but also a way of accelerating future product developments (i.e. open platforms).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Automobile Reinvention is Under Way\\n\\n\\nIn order to lead this reinvention, manufacturers, suppliers and technology companies are focusing on four specific areas:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElectrification – \\nFossil fuels are giving way to cleaner, more sustainable electricity in vehicles at an accelerating pace. In the bold future, fuel economy and range become secondary considerations outweighed by the benefits of electrification (remember, we didn’t stop using carriages because we ran out of horses). Vehicles will become electrified vessels, which are propelled, connected and personalized with circuitry and current rather than gasoline. It’s not just vehicles that are becoming electrified – from scooters and bikes to buses and semi-trucks, all are offering increasing flexibility, with limited compromise. Moreover, infrastructure improvements – not just added charging points, but apps helping consumers leverage the cheapest and fastest sources of charging – will smooth the wrinkles of some of the current barriers. New charging solutions may emerge, and battery capacity will undoubtedly continue to expand.\\n\\n\\nConnectedness – \\nToday, we pair our phone with the car and we consider ourselves “connected.” But the future of connected services includes a variety of variables – human to vehicle, vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure, and beyond – that represent a key stepping stone to full autonomy. To that end, the coming of 5G is a game-changer that will bring with it new levels of cellular reliability and speed which can rival our current home/office experience. One of the interesting questions is how we will communicate this new mobility experience. How do we help consumers make the transition from experiencing the physical features of car (“butts in seats”) to the digital experience (“thumbs on buttons”)?\\n\\n\\nShared Mobility – \\nAs the relationship with our car transforms into this symbiotic and connected experience, the ideal of vehicle “ownership” or household fleet will change as well. Technologies which will increase utilization efficiency exponentially will also foster greater interest in shared mobility \\n–\\n as consumers may find saving money or reducing carbon footprint more important than individual autonomy. One can envision that more of our transportation needs will no longer be tied to a particular vehicle, but will be portable to the most convenient form of transit on a given day. Integration with other forms of shared mobility – including aviation and rail, or individual mobility, such as scooters – will provide access to everyone, regardless of age, health, income or legal constraints. This likely represents the final step that will facilitate full autonomy.\\n\\n\\nAutonomous Driving\\n \\n–\\n One could expect that, at first, we will see the rise of “dedicated” autonomous lanes or zones to provide the clearest path for driverless vehicles. But, along with the physical advances of features and infrastructure must come a way to reassure consumers of their ability to trust the features and functions of an autonomous vehicle. Safety, security and privacy considerations – hallmarks of today’s insecure computing infrastructure – become even more integral when lives are at stake.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSo with all that said, it was exciting to witness the beginning of a new era. The opportunities at the intersection of the trends and areas of reinvention are plentiful. Technology will help us to overcome some of the limitations of the manufacturing-based business model, and solutions will come through competition between both established and new players, as the race for the future of mobility has begun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAre you ready for the rise of the “smartcar?”\\n\\n\\nIf you have questions or would like to continue the conversation about how you can prepare for the future of mobility, click below to send us a note.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCheck out our AV Report\\n\\n\\nOur team dug into how automotive and mobility companies can encourage autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption amid consumers who fear self-driving technologies.

Tell Your Customer’s.', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/stop-telling-your-story-tell-your-customers/', 'Content': 'Storytelling. It’s such an often-used phrase that it’s becoming a cliché… and, as a result, losing its original meaning and value. This story is about brand —how we can best use stories to create brand engagement. And how those stories aren’t always about us.\\n\\n\\nThe Power of Unreason in Brand Storytelling\\n\\n\\nAt its root, \\nthe value of branding is the creation of irrational preference.\\n Irrational preference is what keeps a customer purchasing even when a competitor has leap-frogged your offering. It’s what sustains price premium even in commodifying markets. It’s what buys the precious time and opportunity your brand needs to rebound in the midst of a public relations crisis.\\n\\n\\nNo one, in the harsh light of reason, has ever affixed a corporate logo sticker to the bumper of their car. Or, after a cool-headed deliberative process, with a copy of that logo in hand, walked into a tattoo parlor. Debates. Spreadsheets. Comparison charts full of Harvey Balls. None of these tools create irrational preference.\\n\\n\\nBut stories—when told properly—can.\\n\\n\\nHeroes, Sidekicks & Talismans in Brand Stories\\n\\n\\nWhen businesses think about the intersection of storytelling and brand strategy, the first question they should ask is, \\nwho am I telling a story about?\\n Having grown up in the tech industry since the mid-90s, I’ve worked with a lot of engineering-oriented cultures, which tend to shine a spotlight on their product. On a pedestal. With grand crescendos of music swelling in the background. The product—or even the new feature—becomes the hero of the story. And that’s often a mistake.\\n\\n\\nThere’s a role for product-focused messaging. But, when we make our products the heroes of our stories, we risk crowding our customers out of the narrative altogether. We become the obnoxious guy at the party, who can’t stop talking about himself.\\n\\n\\nEffective brand-building helps our customers tell better stories about themselves. They’re the hero of the story—not our brand or product. We’re there to enable that heroism, the loyal sidekick (Watson to their Holmes) or enchanted talisman (Luke’s lightsaber). The reflection they see of themselves in our brand relationship embodies how they want to live their best lives. If we help them tell that story, we build lifelong relationships that deliver deliriously irrational preferences for our brand.\\n\\n\\nLet’s compare two examples. One is recognizably a story, but without a way in for its customer. The other is a fantastically effective, customer-focused story…even though it lacks many of the traditional trappings of narrative.\\n\\n\\nDilly Dilly? A Quest without a Customer\\n\\n\\nA fair amount of ink has already been spilled about Bud Light’s recent Super Bowl campaign. Much of it focused on their distracting crusade (literally, given the medieval trappings) against corn syrup. Yes, this ticked off America’s corn farmers, but leaving jilted agribusinesses aside, the real question is whether Bud Light’s telling a story that helps make a hero of its customer. While you watch the ad and enjoy the wisecracks, ask yourself, where is the customer in this story?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom that perspective, the spots chiefly confuse people. The brand focuses relentlessly on product—and, indeed, on a single ingredient in the product that has, until now, held no salience in the category. Is there corn syrup in beer? Do I care that there’s corn syrup in beer? Like many Super Bowl ads, the Bud Light campaign puts more effort into eliciting laughs than in telling a meaningful story that its customers can identify with. The ad is relentlessly inward-focused —what we do, the ingredients we use. The hero of this quest is Bud Light. And the quest itself is about the brand’s attempt to figure out how to differentiate itself in its own competitive set.\\n\\n\\nUltimately, the campaign leaves no space in the story for the customer, who’s left wondering where they fit in. This is storytelling as navel-gazing, rather than building brand value.\\n\\n\\nElegant Brand Stories Don’t Even Need Words\\n\\n\\nThe Bud Light campaign is very clearly and explicitly a story—a narrative with a beginning, middle, and end. But it’s not an effective story. Apple shows, again and again, how a brand can tell powerful brand stories without even observing the traditional structures and trappings of narrative.\\n\\n\\nConsider Apple’s “dancing shoes” campaign for AirPods. The goal of the campaign was to support the launch of a wireless, premium-priced earbud product. They could have focused on the product itself: how small and unobtrusive it is, how the removal of the wire prevents that awkward spaghetti-tangle in your pocket. Perfectly functional and a rational appeal to System 2 thinking. Instead, they went with this:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple could tell the story of how they’ve made a different kind of product—essentially, a story about themselves. But Bluetooth technology and miniaturized power systems figure as little in this ad as, well, corn syrup in \\nmost\\n beer ads. Instead, Apple makes the customer the hero of the story. Liberation from a cable becomes transmuted into a much more powerful sense of liberation from gravity, as the customer dances along walls and ceilings, unconstrained. The AirPods function as a talisman, enabling us to participate in the liberating joy of music. All without a single explicit product claim.\\n\\n\\nI am liberated. I am joyous.\\n This is the way we see ourselves, as customers, reflected in the mirror of Apple’s brand.\\n\\n\\nHow do you reflect your customers back to themselves—not just in your advertising but across all the touchpoints of your brand experience? In what ways are you their sidekick, their talisman? And how are you helping them tell a story of themselves in which they are the heroes? Unfortunately, the answers to those questions are the foundation of long-lasting irrational preference. Let Escalent help you tell your customer’s story.'}\n","{'Index': 136, 'Heading': 'Superpowers and Princesses: A Three-Minute Lesson on Projective Exercises', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/superpowers-and-princesses-a-three-minute-lesson-on-projective-exercises/', 'Content': 'Projective exercises—the presentation of calibrated stimuli onto which a respondent projects their feelings, attitudes or beliefs—are a critical asset in the qualitative researcher’s emotional toolbox. The technique offers the promise of achieving greater depth and validity of insight by facilitating expression of subconscious or difficult-to-articulate feelings that are less accessible using direct “Q&A.”\\n\\n\\nBut what makes for a good projective exercise?\\n\\n\\nWe put learning into action at a recent market research conference by testing a series of probes that revealed some lessons about projectives.\\n\\n\\nFirst, we asked visitors to our booth to help us learn about, “What makes great qualitative research.” We then invited them to post onto a chalkboard their reactions to a probe related to the goal of understanding how to deliver great\\xa0\\nqualitative research\\n. Our lesson on projectives focuses on contrasting two of several probes that we asked:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is your qualitative superpower?\\n\\n\\nWhat Disney princess would make a great moderator?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore reading on, what do you notice about these questions? Is one easier for you to answer? Do you suspect one would elicit superior insights vs. the other? Let’s explore what we observed and discuss why one question might better achieve the promise of projective techniques.\\n\\n\\nWhat is your qualitative superpower?\\n\\n\\nThis question elicited some interesting responses including humor, empathy, x-ray vision, color coding stuff, cat herding, shoe wearing, connections, fortune-telling and brainstorming solutions.\\n\\n\\nParticipants took time with this question, contemplated it with seriousness and their answers were well thought out before they were posted. While you might be tempted to say, “Yes! This is a good, thought-provoking projective exercise!” think again. This question was difficult, and maybe even a little intimidating, for our fellow market researchers to answer. Starting with body language, respondents tended to step back or to the side when hearing the question. Further, most were unable to answer spontaneously and didn’t necessarily choose a response that was instinctual.\\xa0 Rather, they were apt to carefully articulate a response that others would judge as “correct.” Finally, some shook their heads and walked away without answering.\\n\\n\\nBut why? The answer is that this is a very personal way of probing into “what makes great qualitative research.” The question looks like a projective (given the superpower content), but it’s not because it lacks an object for respondents to project their emotions and thoughts onto. Participants were being asked to directly and publicly reveal a personal quality (a power) that is also open to judgment (the power was supposed to be “super” after all). As a result, the probe created tension and triggered guarded, rational brain/slow thinking and filtered responding that was influenced by self-presentation bias.\\n\\n\\nThis scenario points out an often-overlooked quality of effective projective exercises: True projective exercises are ego-protective. That is, the respondent should be able to answer without worrying about what others will say or that there is a right or wrong answer. Offering an ambiguous object onto which personal traits or feelings are projected creates a safe environment that helps participants access their subconscious and raise it to the surface, priming them for deeper, more emotionally centered insight. By way of analogy, projective exercises are similar to the safe space that is created when a person asks for advice for an issue that their “friend” is having, when in reality, the issue is theirs but they are uncomfortable admitting they’re having a problem.\\n\\n\\nWhat Disney princess would make a great moderator?\\n\\n\\nAnswers included a wide range of princesses, including: Mulan (bold), Esmerelda (tolerant), Belle (inquisitive), Jasmine (intuitive), Merida (determined, curious) and Cinderella (caring). We also had one respondent who didn’t relate well to princesses but offered Dory from Finding Nemo (keeps asking and asking and asking questions).\\n\\n\\nThe princess question was far easier for participants to answer and was candidly much more fun! Respondents didn’t need to think or process to come up with the name of a princess—they knew one immediately. In terms of body language, participants tended to lean in, smile and emote enthusiasm. This was a sharp contrast to the body language and manner of responding elicited by the superpower question.\\n\\n\\nUpon probing as to why a particular princess (or fish) was chosen, rational processing took over and some participants needed a bit of time to search for the rationale for their choices. And that’s fine. The projective device did its job of acting as a prime that helped participants discover and articulate the reasons behind their nomination.\\n\\n\\nOverall, this question is a truer projective exercise that triggered the fast thinking/emotional part of the brain, which is what properly constructed projective exercises do.\\n\\n\\nWhat did we learn?\\n\\n\\nIn summary, our learnings suggest that an effective projective exercise:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs phrased indirectly, offering the ego protection of an object or image that participants can project their feelings and thoughts onto.\\n\\n\\nTriggers an immediate response, accessing the fast-thinking, subconscious part of the brain.\\n\\n\\nMakes emotions more accessible to participants, facilitating exploration of the whys behind the immediate response.\\n\\n\\nIs not about the creative device used. Superpowers, princesses, aliens or nature pictures can all be effective stimuli if the questions asked about them are crafted carefully, but can also be ineffective if worded improperly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, how can we apply this knowledge to rescue our superpower question? It’s a subtle change that’s as simple as making this direct question indirect. For example, “If you could create a qualitative superhero, which superpower(s) would he or she have?”\\n\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this three-minute lesson and that it has helped to strengthen your personal qualitative superpowers!'}\n","{'Index': 137, 'Heading': 'Disconnected: Why OEM Apps Aren’t Riding Shotgun on the Connected Vehicle Journey', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/disconnected-why-oem-apps-arent-riding-shotgun-on-the-connected-vehicle-journey/', 'Content': 'Connected vehicle technology is rapidly becoming ubiquitous, both here in the United States and across the globe. This year, \\naccording to Statista\\n, it is expected that more than 64 million cars worldwide will be shipped with some form of connected tech.\\n\\n\\nFor those proclaiming the arrival of a bold future – one in which cars will pilot their way down the road with little to no input from a human driver – connected services are seen as a major building block of this transformation, and manufacturers clearly are eager to put upgraded tech into the hands of consumers. Ultimately, many OEMs would love it if consumers viewed them as much as mobility providers as manufacturers of transportation products.\\n\\n\\nAs OEMs gain greater ownership stakes in innovative mobility entities, connected services are also seen as a new, recurring revenue stream of the future for the automotive industry. Manufacturers are counting on these services as future drivers of engagement and consumer loyalty, helping to offset declining revenue in other areas.\\n\\n\\nHowever, in a proprietary survey* we recently conducted, it appears that consumers are still struggling to develop a connected relationship with their daily rides. We found that 84 percent of 1,000 drivers surveyed aren’t using mobile apps that OEMs have developed to control aspects of the ownership and driving experience.\\n\\n\\nIt’s a startling statistic, given that mobile application use is a very common consumer practice across most service sectors, from buying tickets online and monitoring news feeds to business practices such as remote industrial control and fleet management. \\nSo why the reluctance to adopt connected car applications? And how do OEMs close this gap?\\n Let’s take a closer look.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMarketing OEM Apps and Connected Services\\n\\n\\nWe learned from our sample group that a majority – 56 percent – weren’t even aware of the existence of an OEM app. This stifling lack of awareness would seem to be an easy hurdle to cure – far easier, it would seem, than convincing the next largest group – 27 percent – who were aware of the existence of the OEM app but weren’t impressed enough to use it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs we delved deeper, we learned that marketing of OEM apps was limited – mostly left to salespeople who may not have the technical background to spotlight key features; or to a link on a website with little fanfare.\\n\\n\\nClearly, more proactive marketing of the apps will help, but it also will be valuable to position these apps as a critical ingredient in “personalizing” the driver experience. Salespeople at the dealership have an opportunity now to use these apps to build trusted relationships with buyers by focusing on features of connected services particular to that individual. If the sales mantra in the past was to get “butts in the seats,” the future will be about getting “thumbs on the buttons.” Focusing on the connected services that heighten the level of interaction between the consumer and the vehicle, and getting consumers to experience the digital relationship with the vehicle can, over time, become a new way to create brand and dealer loyalty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCreating a More Engaging Experience\\n\\n\\nThe most popular features of connected services all endeavor to heighten the direct level of interaction between the driver and the vehicle. That said, it’s the table stakes of the driving experience – things like roadside assistance and navigation – that are seen as most valuable in an OEM app. Though in-vehicle messaging and music streaming are innovative, they rank near the bottom of the survey because they’re not as essential to bringing the driver closer to the automobile as things like maintenance alerts, remote lock/unlock or remote engine start. So it’s not surprising that features that offer the convenience of interacting with the car from a remote location or help to improve the experience with the car, rank near the top.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen asked to be futurists, survey respondents said they hoped that future enhancements to OEM apps would include things like notifications, remote climate control, personalized cabin preparation or remote access to onboard cameras.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nApp School 101\\n\\n\\nThose same salespeople who first introduced the app to the consumer were also called upon to train consumers on their use. Though we cannot draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of salesperson-led training, it’s noteworthy that nearly the same amount of those surveyed opted to educate themselves about the app outside of the dealership. This underscores the importance of making training materials easily available online, so consumers can bone up at their leisure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nReinventing the Customer Relationship\\n\\n\\nBy using the app training experience as another touchpoint toward personalization of the vehicle to the owner’s individual tastes, dealers can build a better relationship between the buyer and the dealership itself. Hence, the new offerings of connected services provide the dealerships with a unique window of opportunity to reinvent the relationship with their customers by focusing on the engagement with the vehicle rather than focusing on just the vehicle itself.\\n\\n\\nIf dealerships can move away from the transaction mindset and, instead, help create a personal relationship between the customer and the vehicle, then dealerships themselves have the opportunity to create a personalized retail experience. They can then better retain their customers outside of warranty lifespan and the relatively long period of time in-between the next car purchase.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDelivering Satisfaction\\n\\n\\nOEM apps tend to receive the best ratings from drivers who have integrated the apps into their routine. A strong majority of drivers surveyed responded that they are very satisfied with the usage of OEM apps, while a very small minority reported not being satisfied at all with the app usage. As OEM app usage is adopted at a greater level, and the insight provided by current users is ascertained and acted on for future feature development, OEM apps can heighten the level of satisfaction and, as a result, increase the loyalty to the brand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, how will the market ultimately embrace OEM apps? As our survey indicates, having a deep and detailed understanding of the digital experience – and the role OEM apps can play in helping to personalize this experience – represents the best pathway to success. Although the adoption of connected services may become more prevalent over time, OEMs and dealers will experience faster and more profitable growth if they understand how to bring the consumer into a level of personalization with the apps. This, in turn, will bring consumers closer to the automobile, and create a more satisfied mobility experience inside and outside of the car.\\n\\n\\nIf we can help you to better understand consumer habits around connected vehicle technology, please send us a note.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*\\nThe data collected by the Escalent Automotive Consumer Pulse Study are weighted to ensure relevant demographic characteristics of the sample matched those of the U.S. general population.\\xa0 All respondents are weighted to U.S. Census Bureau demographic profiles for the U.S. population 18+ on gender, age, income and ethnicity.'}\n","{'Index': 138, 'Heading': 'Maintaining Data Security and Compliance in Market Research', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/maintaining-data-security-and-compliance-in-market-research/', 'Content': 'Editor’s Note: Matt Benard is the Compliance and Information Security Manager at Escalent.

Whether it’s a lonely grandmother connecting with her far-away family, thanks to Alexa and the \\nAmazon Echo Spot\\n, or a busy father scouting Greek food locations with his \\nLG OLED TV\\n with Google Assistant, IoT devices are the present and future answer to consolidating seemingly endless daily tasks and helping consumers connect with family.\\n\\n\\nRapid developments are present everywhere we turn. The 2018 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) featured a \\nSmart Home Marketplace\\n more advanced – and promising – than ever before. In addition to efficient and connection-based clocks and televisions, trusted brands like Kohler, Whirlpool, and Honeywell are showcasing retail innovations promising to make homes safer, healthier, and more comfortable.\\n\\n\\nWhether it’s a refrigerator reminding you that your apples and oranges are about to rot – or a connected dishwasher that starts rinsing your dirty china with a simple voice command – appliances and entertainment technology are joining the ranks of smart automobiles and security systems to become the assistants families and professionals didn’t know they needed.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, \\na recent feature story in Forbes magazine\\n spotlighted how the aforementioned “Alexa” of Amazon fame is now the latest virtual butler to cater to guests staying at Marriott-branded hotels.\\n\\n\\n“Customers tell us they love how easy it is to get information, enjoy entertainment and control connected devices by simply asking Alexa,” explained Amazon VP Daniel Rausch in the Forbes feature. “We want to offer those experiences everywhere customers want them.”\\n\\n\\nConsider how the world recently became captivated by the news that the \\nGoogle Virtual Assistant\\n had used an eerily human sounding voice (replete with “ums” and “ahhs”) to book a hair appointment by phone. Clearly, our ability to engage in multiple tasks at one time – while enjoying the experience – is advancing at a rapid pace that both shocks and delights the American and global consumer base.\\n\\n\\nFrom predictive data collection to nearly overnight developments in natural language processing, consumer-oriented brands in all industries are eager to capitalize off the many benefits these devices provide.

One of the easiest arguments to make to consumers is that it helps them save time while delivering a needed boost in a world of instant gratification. Though companies are finding ways to benefit on their end of the IoT paradigm, what will they need to overcome consumer resistance to giving up a modicum of privacy and control in order to foster wider adoption of the technologies?\\n\\n\\n1. Consumer Brand Loyalty\\n\\n\\nIn a society dominated by brand loyalty, consumers want to know the trusted entities behind the technology – and these savvy virtual assistants. For example, \\nMarriott’s Guestroom Innovation Lab\\n collaborates with Samsung and Legrand to optimize their stay experience. As a result of this technology partnership, guests will interact with Bixby and store much of their data in the ARTIK platform and SmartThings cloud. Put simply, they must like and trust these brands to want to use them. This phenomenon extends across industries.\\n\\n\\nA family’s smart thermostat may be powered by Alexa, for example – but there still are a limited number of tasks the assistant can handle. If they do not enjoy using Alexa, their continued adoption of similar technology may dwindle. By the same regard, some products will be powered by Apple, while others will run on Google technology. Whether it is the voice assistant drivers used in their Toyota – or the underlying technology which powers the commands to control kitchen appliances, for example \\xa0– helping consumers define the relationship between the perks of their devices and who drives them is key.\\n\\n\\nWhile it is possible enterprises will be overthinking consumer loyalty to Apple, Microsoft, or another entity, it will behoove them to help their buyers understand who is owning and collecting their data – and how it helps them to achieve their goals and complete daily tasks. In turn, the organizations creating the technology will benefit by hashing out how their devices and clouds interconnect.\\n\\n\\n2. Privacy Concerns and the Race for Data Collection\\n\\n\\nAs alluded to previously, the battle is on for the ownership and collection of data by technology companies. The more information businesses have about people using smart IoT devices, the more they will be able to enhance consumer experience and dominate their marketplace. Like-minded, competitive organizations will not be sharing consumer data, so building trust matters. \\xa0Autonomous vehicle manufacturers, smart television makers, and blue-chip appliance giants can be sure that their customers haven’t yet forgotten about the \\nFacebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal\\n – or the almost regular notices they receive about their data being included in a restaurant or bank data breach. It is how they handle consumer perception that will drive future adoption.\\n\\n\\nThere are also concerns about \\nIoT smart device spying\\n – and the potential security risks that come with billions of cars, appliances, and entertainment products being connected by the year 2020. With this discussion, however, comes promise – the global market will grow to \\nup to $475 billion\\n by then – a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of a whopping 28.5 percent.\\n\\n\\n3. Consumer Budgets, Product Lifecycles, and Device Efficiency\\n\\n\\nIf you have ever had to argue with Siri to get an answer to a simple question, you know the first-hand limitations of smart tech. At a minimum, all devices need to learn from Google Virtual Assistant’s example – concisely understanding what the consumer is saying and using it to complete myriad tasks. Businesses will have to grapple with people who don’t want to adopt new or difficult technology, so ease of use is essential.\\n\\n\\nThese factors intersect with consumer budget. When weighing benefits of smart IoT devices vs. price, difficulty or affordability of adoption may affect the speed at which the industry evolves. For example, a millennial who recently bought a 2016 KIA Soul has some voice capability in their car, but not the newest technology. While they may think new IoT innovations are neat, they are not going to necessarily invest in a new car until they finish making payments. At the point they buy a brand new vehicle, they will upgrade to the latest technology – and then learn how to use it. Many companies at CES argued about the impact price point will have in the speed of adoption – it will be less painful for consumers to buy a smart dishwasher or clock versus a $30,000 vehicle.\\n\\n\\n4. Global Adoption of Smart IoT\\n\\n\\nWhile it is relatively simple to predict the future of the smart IoT device industry in the fast-paced, instantly gratified United States, it is additionally important for large organizations to consider how the rest of the world deploys and utilizes the technology. While Apple, Google, and Amazon are among the most trusted and used brands in America, Asian and European consumers prefer \\nSouth Korea’s Samsung\\n and other local companies while \\nApple’s popularity declines\\n in large markets like China.\\n\\n\\nSince there are various technological and societal dynamics across the world, companies interested in capitalizing off smart IoT devices must complete their due diligence via extensive and relevant research to understand the various marketplaces in which they compete.\\n\\n\\n5. Growing Consumer Industries by Leveraging the Benefits of IoT\\n\\n\\nAdvancements in IoT devices are undoubtedly useful and exciting to both customers and consumer-based industries. However, it is up to the organizations creating innovative products to transform their knowledge about clients’ emotions, needs, and wants into a trust-building engagement strategy.\\n\\n\\nAutomotive companies, for example, must learn how to balance headlines about self-driving car fatalities with public knowledge about the prevalence and usefulness of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), while large home appliance leaders should leverage data to overcome consumers’ inner battle between cost, budget, and benefit.\\xa0 No matter how advanced a TV or sedan becomes, consumer attitude will drive adoption. These organizations should focus on ways to engage their customer base to add context and establish the “why” factor in using their products.\\n\\n\\nIt is the everyday mission of Escalent to assist companies in understanding these nuances through research about consumer habits to support the value proposition of their devices. The companies who currently make IoT devices are primarily focused on technological advancement and product features but ignore customer perception at their own peril. If enterprises can turn consumer data and sentiment into a strategy that delivers on promises of better efficiency and improved connectivity, the increase in global smart IoT will be coupled with a sentiment that consumers cannot live without it. The drive of habit change is trust – and research to inform development, implementation, and marketing strategies will bridge the gap.\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to learn more about how you can best leverage consumer research to create products that delight your customers, click below to send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 140, 'Heading': 'Changing Tides in IoT New Product Development', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/changing-tides-in-iot-new-product-development/', 'Content': 'In early February 2018, I was lucky enough to embark on what many might consider the trip of a lifetime.\\n\\n\\nMy wife and I, along with three other couples, arranged a \\nbareboat charter\\n to sail around the \\nAbaco Islands\\n in the northeast Bahamas for eight days and seven nights. The chartered 40’ catamaran was our “home” for the subsequent week’s adventure of going somewhere new and different each day. If you are considering taking a trip like this, I can’t recommend it enough. As Nike says – just do it!\\n\\n\\nBack home, and finally remembering what I did for my day job, came a realization.\\n\\n\\nMy sailing trip parallels well with the development of innovative solutions here at Escalent, and the lessons we continue to learn in the product development process: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFind someone to captain the ship in unfamiliar territory\\n\\n\\nFocus first, then iterate development so you don’t end up marooned at sea\\n\\n\\nDon’t let rough seas deter your development – embrace a flexible and adaptive mindset that comes with new adventures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy focus over the last 18 months has been facilitating a cross-functional team to develop big data and IoT capabilities within Escalent – specifically, our first-ever commercially-released mobile application, \\nDataDialogue™|Pulse\\n. This app takes our knowledge of commercial fleets and their business purpose as well as our experience working with telematics data to provide fleet professionals with an easy-to-use mobile app designed to prioritize performance issues adversely impacting profitability.\\n\\nWith data management and analytics in our marketing research DNA, that sounds pretty straightforward, right? Hardly. It has required deep internal engagements, a lot of perspective, and some key partnerships along the way.\\n\\n\\nIn any new venture, it is paramount to be strategic in your pursuits, working closely with partners, as needed.\\n\\n\\nSeems like a no-brainer, but it is not always easy. This requires you and your team to be completely honest with yourselves—taking a good, hard look in the mirror. The key is to \\nplay to your strengths \\nand find partners to supplement you where needed.\\n\\n\\nIn my boating analogy, a friend in the group is a certified and licensed captain, so we were not required to hire a captain or crew. With the captain in place, the other seven of us were the de facto crew. While this was our second trip as a group, we still leaned on his expertise to navigate us safely through the sea. Who knows where we would have ended up if I was captain of that ship.\\n\\n\\nAs we’ve built DataDialogue|Pulse, there are skills and workflows required that are not necessarily the forte of a traditional marketing research company. After some internal cross-functional efforts and debate, we partnered and consulted with a Michigan-based fleet, data scientist, and application development agency (among others) to supplement our product development process with their deeper subject matter expertise.\\n\\n\\nWe see this in today’s changing automotive landscape as well. OEMs are acquiring or partnering within the mobility and \\nautonomy\\n ecosystems with focused start-ups in hopes of getting a leg up in the race to establish a presence in this emerging space. Generally, the more narrowly-focused start-ups lend a much deeper, specific expertise to the broader-focused OEM.\\n\\n\\nYou want to start with the end in mind. Develop a solution that delivers the minimum acceptable level of value and iterate solutions from there.\\n\\n\\nEspecially in today’s tech-centric approach to development, you must begin with a vision for a \\nminimum viable product\\n – a set of features and content that is essential to the success of the product or service. From there, you can plan for more detailed development around expansion in future iterations.\\n\\n\\nThis also requires you to acknowledge selecting tools that work best for your problem/solution, and not vice versa. For example, we built the proof of concept within Microsoft’s PowerBI offering. This worked quite well for that stage of development, however, we ultimately opted for a custom app build to deliver the long-term scalable solution.\\n\\n\\nOur trip began and ended at the same marina, so we planned an overall course to achieve this. We certainly couldn’t stray hundreds of miles into the open ocean – after all, we had to end back where we started. This required deciding which islands and cays would best fit into a desirable route. Lastly, we decided on the specifics of choosing which islands and activities we wanted to enjoy.\\n\\n\\nDespite all the planning in the world, your development process will ebb and flow. In the face of it, you will forge ahead even better if you remain flexible.\\n\\n\\nDoing so requires an adaptive mindset. Seas and weather change, as does the business environment. You have to constantly assess your situation for disruption or, if you’re lucky, opportunity. Things do not always go as planned, so you need to be able to think quickly, improvise strategically, and move on.\\n\\n\\nFortunately in sailing, if the weather becomes prohibitive, there isn’t much of an option than to stay put and ride it out. In business, that generally isn’t the best strategy. Many times, it may require reversing some decisions or work completed to get back onto the best path of development. Do not be discouraged by setbacks; rather, embrace them and learn from them. Sometimes, small setbacks can be the catalyst for an even better strategy.\\n\\n\\nIn our app, we had assumed a relationship of one fleet manager to one fleet business. We quickly learned that one fleet manager may oversee multiple business lines. This dynamic forced our hand to allow for one user to profile multiple fleets’ data sets. While it was a step back in development, it also gave us a more scalable and robust solution in the long run.\\n\\n\\nAs inspiration to you on your path to new product development, I share a handful of adages that ring true for us on our path to developing DataDialogue | Pulse:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBe a trailblazer, take the road less traveled.\\n\\n\\nIf it was easy, everyone would be doing it.\\n\\n\\nTake calculated risks – nothing ventured, nothing gained.\\n\\n\\nEmbrace the opportunity to learn and grow, but fail fast.\\n\\n\\nEnjoy the ride – it’s about the journey as well as the destination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to learn more about our new product development learnings or DataDialogue, click below to send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 141, 'Heading': 'The IoT Frontier: Developing a Data-Driven Mindset', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/the-iot-frontier-developing-a-data-driven-mindset/', 'Content': 'As professionals, we often hear about expanding our horizons. How frequently do we actually do so? In reality, not very often. We get comfortable, and, we are experts at what we do anyway, right?\\n\\n\\nCommercial Vehicles. Fleets. Construction Equipment. I’ve done plenty of research projects with these professionals.\\n\\n\\nBig Data. \\nInternet of Things\\n. I’ve heard plenty about these concepts and do work with a lot of data.\\n\\n\\nNow put all those ingredients into a pot and distill them into something useful for professionals in those industries?\\xa0 That’s a different kind of problem. It requires new tools. New skills. A new way of thinking. A new understanding.\\n\\n\\nTruthfully, everyone’s reality is different and being made uncomfortable is not easy for most.\\n\\n\\nThe last two years of my career have been a whirlwind of discomfort for me. And I’ve loved every minute of it. Learning, growing, helping – each in parallel with teammates and partners alike. In establishing a data-driven mindset, we’ve embraced a new way of thinking to get to a new understanding. It’s been incredible!\\n\\n\\nIt’s now late into 2017, and I recently attended the \\nNorth American Commercial Vehicle Show\\n, \\nNTEA Executive Leadership Summit\\n, and \\nEquipmentWatch’s Traction 2017\\n.\\n\\n\\nInteracting with fleet and equipment professionals at these and other trade shows forced me to personally broaden my horizons, and embrace the pain points that may make these professionals uncomfortable. I quickly realized that my reality as a Market Research professional differs greatly from that of a Fleet Manager or an Equipment Manager.\\n\\n\\nThrough the lens of this experience, I’ve identified \\nthree main guideposts that professionals can follow to develop a data-driven mindset, leverage the expanding Internet of Things (IoT), and reap the rewards for their business\\n.\\n\\n\\n1: Big Data is a Big Deal & Getting Bigger with the IoT\\n\\n\\nLet’s start with something that most industries in existence are familiar with – Data. Data. Data.\\n\\n\\nData has long been available from an enterprise perspective – financial data, employee data, customer data, and transaction data, among others. Most have utilized each source of data independently for their own practical, everyday needs. Some have integrated the data for a broader application.\\n\\n\\nOperational data is becoming much more prevalent today – passive data coming in from sensors integrated with all types of equipment and applications used to conduct our everyday business and in our personal lives.\\n\\n\\nWith the IoT, I expect the growth curve of data to be an exponential factor the likes of which we may have never seen before. I’ve heard the term “4\\nth\\n Industrial Revolution” thrown about. I’m not totally sold on that scope just yet, but it seems more possible than not from my perspective.\\n\\n\\nGetting the data is often not terribly difficult. Making sense of it is slightly more difficult. Harnessing the power held in these disparate data sources? Broad success stories are far and few between.\\n\\n\\nSo how do we get past this hurdle?\\n\\n\\n2: Data Integration is Key\\n\\n\\nEveryone has data. Few have truly harnessed the power of integrating their data to the extent it could be today.\\n\\n\\nTo use an example from a long haul transportation perspective, integrating truck telematics data can give you the amount of fuel burned while a tractor is idling. Layer contextual feedback from a driver survey to understand the idle situation and deem an idle event necessary or unnecessary from a business perspective. Lastly, layering that with fuel spend and you can see how much money is lost due to unnecessary idling.\\n\\n\\nThere are lots of high quality solutions in the burgeoning market that provide services around the IoT ecosystem – telematics hardware, internal/external CRM, database architecture, reporting dashboards. As of yet, not many have fully embraced data integration.\\n\\n\\nThat doesn’t even get into what I feel like is the next technology wave of data integration – blockchain. That’s a whole topic in its own right.\\n\\n\\nFor small to midsize organizations, this highlights a challenge – they often don’t have the time available or skill set needed to integrate their own data across platforms.\\n\\n\\nUltimately, baby steps are critical to integration efforts. Partner. Discuss. Get smarter. Get better. Rome wasn’t built in a day.\\n\\n\\n3: Any IoT Solution has to be Easy to Use\\n\\n\\nThe integration of data at the business level leads to a “what’s next?” question of sorts.\\n\\n\\nSometimes, a reporting dashboard can be a solution. For others, it’s an app delivering their data and insights.\\n\\n\\nAny solution in this space needs to be data-driven and actionable to be most useful and effective for industry executives.\\n\\n\\nIt also needs to be simple and easy to use. Time is money. \\xa0Difficult to use and hard to understand solutions cost a company more time and more money.\\n\\n\\nCurrently, I’m contributing to a data-driven solution that delivers descriptive dashboards and actionable light-prescriptive reports that, with ongoing interaction, can develop into full predictive and prescriptive systems.\\n\\n\\nFrom my perspective, full prescriptive and predictive analytics come with nothing more than time and data pumped into the appropriate systems. Those claiming the ability to do so already are quite far ahead of the curve.\\n\\n\\nData is King\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo work through these steps requires some keen self-awareness and the desire to embrace a data-driven decision-making approach around business and competitive intelligence.\\n\\n\\nIn each case, we get there one way – by data.\\n\\n\\nNew technologies are allowing data to be brought in, analyzed, and presented to stakeholders in ways never before imagined.\\n\\n\\nDoing so represents a whole new batch of challenges at the same time.\\n\\n\\nDo we have the time? Do we have the people? Do we have the money?\\n\\n\\nYes. Yes. Yes. You have to.\\n\\n\\nIf you answer “yes” to all the above, then you’re golden. If you don’t answer “yes, I do internally” to all the above, that’s OK too. One way to shorten your timeline is to say “yes, I do by partnerships.”\\n\\n\\nThe risk of not saying “yes” and taking action in this new frontier is potentially greater than taking action and failing, but still learning along the way.\\n\\n\\nIf you have questions or would like to learn more about how to have a data-driven mindset, click below to send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 142, 'Heading': 'Brand Loyalty: Vying for the Throne', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/brand-loyalty-vying-for-the-throne/', 'Content': 'Editor’s note: This is a spoiler alert for fans of Game of Thrones (GOT). You may not want to continue reading unless, of course, you want an entertaining way of looking at what drives brand allegiance.\\n\\n\\nLike 8.9 million other people, I sat riveted to my television when the season finale of GOT aired. If you’ve never seen the show or read the novels, here’s a quick, overly-simplistic synopsis: There exists a large kingdom called Westeros. The king of Westeros dies. Many others vie for the throne, each with a considerably decent claim to it. Not surprisingly, few are open to reasonable, sit-down discussions to determine whose claim is best, and thus, things must be decided the old-fashioned way: war.\\xa0 To win a war, you need an army. And to obtain an army, you need loyal subjects. Thus, one could say the content of five books/six seasons of TV follows each individual’s story as he or she attempts to win over others to his/her side. I’m on Team Dany. Daenerys “Dany” Targaryen’s family ruled Westeros for thousands of years before the now deceased king took over. Although legacy isn’t everything, her lineage gives her a lot of street cred.\\xa0 If I lived in the seven kingdoms, I would certainly declare for Daenerys as Queen of Westeros—and according to the end of the season finale, several thousand others agree.\\n\\n\\nBut it took a while for Daenerys to achieve this support. How did she go from being a frightened girl with a wish to rule in Season One to a confident woman with an impressive legion of backers in Season Six? What is it about her, her decisions or her journey that inspired such loyalty?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe sets herself apart from the competition.\\n Let’s start with the obvious: The lady has dragons—kind of a big deal in a historically mystical land like Westeros where dragons haven’t been on the scene for generations. Dany’s three impressive dragon “children” certainly give her an unique edge that other claimants sorely lack. And perhaps more importantly, the dragons are synonymous with her name.\\n\\n\\nShe stays true to her vision.\\n Dany’s rise to the top wasn’t easy. Despite everyday obstacles—you know, like the loss of your husband and child to a revengeful maegi and being held captive in a bizarre fun house by warlocks—she remains in tune with the needs of her followers and the changing political climate while never losing sight of her original vision.\\n\\n\\nShe puts her followers first.\\n Dany’s resolve is only matched by her altruism. It’s clear through her actions and choices that she truly wants to do good as a ruler and that means putting her constituents’ needs before her own—at times, to the tune of an uprising or self-sacrifice of personal affections.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“What in the kingdom does this have to do with market research?”\\n I’m glad you asked.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhich brands do you “declare” for? Which have inspired true loyalty? \\nAnd I don’t mean from which brands you buy often, but for which brands you would be willing to pledge your allegiance.\\n I believe brands that cultivate the most long-lasting relationships with consumers are those that:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarve out a unique niche.\\n Whether it’s a \\nparticularly impressive product\\n, a customer service strategy or stylish design and packaging —great brands find ways to synonymize that strength with their name.\\n\\n\\nContinue to evolve.\\n I don’t mean just to meet consumer needs but also to the ever-changing marketplace and industry standards, while holding tight to their mission and organizational vision.\\n\\n\\nKeep the customer #1, no matter what.\\n Amidst all the potential business strategies to improve branding, choosing the strategy that \\nprioritizes the customer\\n will always pay off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust as no queen should be without a trusted advisor, no brand should be without one either. At Escalent, we understand that a “one and done” study approach won’t cut it. Solid branding is an iterative process that takes careful planning.\\n\\n\\nTo be the best, you need research insights that illuminate and communicate the above to your consumers.

In addition to maintaining one of the largest advertising budgets on the planet at the time, the organization also plowed tens of millions of dollars into high-profile sports sponsorships. Yet unlike the advertising spend, which was subjected to intense scrutiny to measure impact and return on investment, the sponsorships ran year after year with little or no measurement of their value or effectiveness.\\n\\n\\nWhen I, as a curious little whippersnapper, dared to ask why we only measured one side of the marketing mix, I received only terse replies that included “The brand is tied to the event, so why waste money measuring it when we know we have to do it anyway,” “Don’t be silly, there’s no proper way to measure sponsorships,” and “As long as the chairman can still walk 18 holes at St Andrews, we’ll be sponsoring golf tournaments, regardless.” I recall feeling quite disturbed at what I perceived to be not only a marketing blind spot but a gross oversight in corporate governance. Two decades on, I’m still amazed at how often the area of sponsorships is overlooked when organizations measure the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.\\n\\n\\nAn Elephant Hiding in Plain Sight\\n\\n\\nSponsorship spend in North America will exceed $21 billion in 2015, which is equal to one-third of total television advertising, or one-half of all digital advertising. Nearly three-quarters of this is spent on sports, which won’t surprise anyone that has turned on a TV or been to a stadium in recent years. Sponsorship spend is also increasing at a faster rate than anything else in the marketing mix, having grown by 4.2% in 2014, compared to 3.1% for advertising and just 2.8% for public relations/promotions/direct marketing.\\n\\n\\n \\xa0 \\xa0 \\n\\n\\nSponsorship fees themselves are typically only half of the equation, as they are often more than matched by subsequent spending to advertise and promote them, so it’s fair to say that this area of marketing will approach $50 billion in spend before the year is out. You’d think that such a substantial marketing investment would be supported by a powerhouse of research in order to determine its effectiveness. But you’d be wrong. A \\nrecent analysis\\n by the Association of National Advertisers uncovered some alarming statistics:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly 35% of marketers consistently measure the impact and effectiveness of their sponsorship activities.\\n\\n\\nA full 25% of marketers do not gather, analyze or use any data at all in their sponsorship decision-making, choosing to work on gut instinct alone.\\n\\n\\nOf those that do conduct some form of measurement, only 47% have implemented a standardized process for sponsorship measurement.\\n\\n\\nWhen carrying out sponsorship measurement, only half of marketers make any attempt to isolate the impact of sponsorships from their other marketing initiatives.\\n\\n\\nYet nearly 80% report that the need to validate sponsorship results has increased significantly in the past two years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf those numbers aren’t bad enough, in many cases where sponsorship research is actually conducted, the analysis is carried out by either the ad agency or the sponsorship management company. And once the foxes are looking after the henhouse, it’s not surprising that in many cases this research is biased, weak on meaningful measures and consequently not particularly valuable to decision-makers.\\n\\n\\nNon-Measurement for All the Wrong Reasons\\n\\n\\nThe reasons for this apparent blind spot are numerous. Very often, organizations invest so much budget and energy into a sponsorship that they simply don’t leave anything more to measure the impact. In other cases, nobody bothers to measure sponsorship effectiveness because the sponsorship “just feels right.” After all, who is going to argue that having the corporate logo plastered across a major sporting arena is anything but a marketing coup?\\n\\n\\nOther times, the sponsorship is a pet project of an executive, or the organization has been doing it for many years, so conducting an assessment of the sponsorship value potentially carries some political risk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTop Tip: Measure Outcomes, Not Outputs\\n\\n\\nMany marketers make the mistake of collecting data that are easy to measure, rather than what actually matters. As a result, they end up measuring ‘outputs’ such as what a sponsor got or did, rather than ‘outcomes’—what a sponsorship actually produced with the target audience. The most common outputs measured are media exposure and digital impressions. But these proxy measures aren’t able to capture whether a sponsorship actually impacted perceptions, attitudes and behaviors, leading to purchase and other desired actions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerhaps most alarmingly, the most oft-cited reason for not measuring the effectiveness of sponsorships is that marketers don’t see the value, or worse still, just don’t know how to do it. One of my client-partners recently captured her sponsorship challenges rather succinctly when she said:\\n\\n\\n“Most of us don’t even know where to start. Tallying of press coverage or social media buzz is just so cumbersome and doesn’t really give me anything meaningful. But if I do primary research with our target market, how do I tie that back into our brand research, or reliably link it to the measures that matter to my executives, like sales and profits?” \\n\\n\\nWith this frustration in mind, let’s take a look at the “why” and “how” of good sponsorship measurement.\\n\\n\\nWhy You Need to Measure\\n\\n\\nMore than 100 US companies have sponsorship budgets in excess of $15 million, and the largest sponsors such as Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Nike and Anheuser-Busch spend well in excess of $200 million per annum. Given the size of these investments, the rationale for measurement should be obvious, and includes the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate Governance:\\n Like any other company expenditure, the sponsorship spend needs to be clearly justified. So doing the research that identifies the causal links between the investment and corporate KPIs and/or financial returns is a critical corporate governance function that marketing is obliged to undertake.\\n\\n\\nProtect your Budget:\\n If you want to protect your sponsorship budget for next year, set about proving the value that it’s providing this year. Maintaining a consistent budget is particularly important for sponsorships associated with popular properties (e.g. NFL or MLB) where there are considerably more sponsors, many of whom might have been around for decades. In these instances, it may take years of investment to “break in” and gain consistent awareness and behavioral change with fans.\\n\\n\\nPrioritize Opportunities: \\nMost companies spread their budgets between a number of sponsorship properties in order to maximize reach or target disparate audiences. Effective measurement allows you to assess the relative merit of each sponsorship as it relates to corporate goals, allowing you to make informed decisions about which sponsorships to maintain and where to prioritize budget.\\n\\n\\nRenegotiation Power:\\n Perhaps the greatest value you’ll see from effective sponsorship measurement is when it comes to renegotiating your sponsorship contract. Having detailed data regarding what works best for your company provides you with far greater power, allowing you to focus on the opportunities that matter and negotiate a cost that you can confidently predict will deliver an ROI. I’ve recently witnessed a client-partner optimize the modules of their sponsorship with a major US sports league while saving nearly $10 million, all through having the right insights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow You Should Measure Sponsorships\\n\\n\\nThe ‘how’ is where most marketers get stuck, but, in fact, it’s relatively easy to get started with some fundamentals. The first step is to determine who is going to do the measurement, and if you’re looking for the data to deliver actionable insights and have credibility with your leadership, my strong recommendation is that you hire a team of independent professionals. Don’t let foxes into your henhouse.\\n\\n\\nThe second step is to clearly define your audience on the front end. The audience definition should be relatively obvious—after all, you got into this sponsorship in the first place to reach a specific target segment. Perhaps you’re a tech brand looking to reach a senior business audience at a golf tournament, or maybe you’re an energy drinks brand that is looking to connect with Millennials by sponsoring a series of music concerts.\\xa0 Whatever the segment(s), have the demographic profile clearly defined up-front so you can zero in on the impact with the people that matter most to your brand.\\n\\n\\nBut don’t stop there. An even more crucial (but often overlooked) part of audience definition is fan classification, and specifically defining the ‘avidity’ of fans. Typically, you’ll want to define three fan classes:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAvid fans\\n who are deeply involved in the sponsorship property through regular attendance or viewership of events, as well as other engagement (e.g. online, social media)\\n\\n\\nCasual fans\\n who have more of a passing interest\\n\\n\\nNon-fans\\n who have no interest at all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing fan classes to break out different audience segments in your research will allow you to benchmark your impact based upon the level of engagement with the sponsorship property, see how closely your target market matches the fan base and, ultimately, measure the lift that is achieved over the general population.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTop Tip: Define Your Avid Fan Up-Front\\n\\n\\nHow do you determine if a person is an ‘avid’ fan? The truth is, it can vary greatly from one sponsorship property to another. I strongly recommend running a short pre-survey for fan classification purposes, getting measures for awareness, interest, attendance/viewership, and different types of engagement. Subsequent analysis of the combinations of these measures should provide clear fan segments that can then be utilized in the core research.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen it’s down to business—conducting primary research within the broader market to measure the impact of the sponsorship. To do this, your research will need to pay attention to both sponsorship health and brand health.\\n\\n\\nSponsorship Health\\n measures how well the sponsorship itself is performing and needs to focus on the following key areas:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAwareness:\\n You’re more than likely doing awareness testing as part of your brand tracking and advertising testing, and it’s important to apply the same principles here. At an unaided and aided level, are respondents able to recall your overall sponsorship of a property, or specific facets of it (e.g., a halftime advertisement)?\\n\\n\\nPerceptions:\\n Of those that are aware of the sponsorship, how do they perceive it? Do they find it appealing? Do they think it’s a good fit? Does it cause them to want to take action?\\n\\n\\nEngagement: \\nGoing deeper than pure awareness, look to implement measures that align with what the sponsorship advertising is trying to achieve. Think of specific actions that are taken by the consumer as a result of exposure to the sponsorship, such as researching online, visiting a store or making a purchase. This is more nuanced than awareness metrics, but crucial to proving an ROI that aligns with the original objectives, so focus on getting a tight measure on actual behavioral change as a direct result of the sponsorship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTest Your Own Awareness\\n\\n\\nMarketers regularly overestimate the impact of their sponsorship and, upon conducting research, are often stunned when they stumble at the very first hurdle–awareness. It’s not uncommon to find that less than 20% of avid fans are able to recall even the largest sponsors.\\n\\n\\nDoes that sound really low? Why not test your own awareness. Grab a pen and paper, write down the major US sports leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and NCAA), and now try to recall the largest sponsors next to each. Done? Check the table at the end of this article—you’ll be amazed how many well-known brands you completely forgot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrand Health\\n measures the specific impact of the sponsorship on brand equities and the consumer journey (or purchase funnel). Sound familiar? Of course it does—you’re likely doing a lot of \\nbrand research\\n already, so here’s your opportunity to tie the two together and enhance the value of each. The key is to leverage the brand research you conduct with the general market, and ask exactly the same questions of those that have been exposed to the sponsorship. Stand the two pieces of research side-by-side, and you’ll be able to determine the incremental lift that the sponsorship is delivering to brand equities as well as purchase funnel metrics such as awareness, knowledge, consideration, preference and purchase. Remember, if you’ve done a good job of audience definition, you’ll be able to not only get the headline measures, but also build detailed cross-tabs to compare the lift in specific demographics and fan classes. So, for example, you should note greater lift among avid fans, but is this lift consistent across all income groups?\\n\\n\\nThe final step is the one that will matter most to your leadership: taking these incremental lift percentages and applying them back to actual population volumes. This will provide you with actual raw numbers of people that have been directly impacted by the sponsorship. If you’ve nailed down your engagement metrics well, you will be able to measure the volumes of consumers that, for example, now have a stronger preference for your brand over competitors, or an increased intent to purchase. Apply those volumes to the actual cost of your product—whether it’s soda, cellphones or SUVs—and you will be able to not only calculate incremental revenue attributable to the business as a result of the sponsorship investment, but also determine the overall ROI for the sponsorship as a whole.\\n\\n\\nNext Stop: Rolling Up Your Sleeves\\n\\n\\nOf course there is much more that can be done to dig into the finer details of sponsorship effectiveness. Once you have the framework outlined above in place, you can begin to overlay additional measures and sources of data—for example, digital media metrics associated with ad clicks or social media buzz, or actual behavioral data collected from sponsorship engagement activities (texts responding to a halftime ad on the Jumbotron, or your call-to-action hashtags embedded in tweets).\\n\\n\\nIt’s all possible once the need for sponsorship measurement is acknowledged and the fundamentals have been put in place. Before you know it, your organization will be making sponsorship decisions based on detailed and reliable insights, and not on whether your chairman still gets out on the golf course.\\n\\n\\nHow are your sponsorships performing?

I remember not too long ago when it seemed like that was something that I needed–or felt I needed–to do every two years.\\xa0 My current plan still allows for that subsidized option, but after some thought, I concluded that I really have no need for a new handset. The one I have is quite versatile, and it does everything I want it to do in a format that meets my needs. I could upgrade to the latest version which might have an even bigger screen and some additional features, but do I really need it?\\n\\n\\nCoveting\\xa0the Latest & Greatest\\n\\n\\nSome recent conversations with clients about methodologies and paradigms have made it clear to me that market researchers fall victim to this same desire for the latest and greatest. In this case, we’re not switching out handsets but rather methodologies or analytical approaches. Sometimes it appears that the decision of which solution to use to answer a research question has been driven by this desire to try something new rather than simply to answer the business question. In this day and age of more powerful computers and advanced algorithms, it is easy for marketing scientists like me to propose an increasingly advanced solution. But, given the wide array of analytical tools, it is important to make sure the analytics we are proposing are really necessary to answer the business question.\\n\\n\\nTo that end, I think it’s\\xa0important to understand the following when advising on methodology:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness Question:\\n My experience has shown that probing on this often uncovers a different or modified question than that which was initially asked. Uncovering this hidden question will likely impact or alter your analytical path.\\n\\n\\nRole of the Research:\\n Understanding how the results will be used and the decisions that are to be informed can impact which analytics you need. Are your results feeding into a forecast, or do they simply need to be directional in nature?\\n\\n\\nBudget: \\nSome methodologies will require greater sample sizes or larger analytical budgets than what’s available. As you develop the research plan, you may also discover interests in certain respondent groups (e.g., segments) for which additional budget had not been reserved. Under these circumstances, it is often necessary to revisit the business question to make sure it can still be answered.\\xa0 Oftentimes the answer is “yes, with a modified approach,” but some of the “nice to have” answers may need to be sacrificed.\\n\\n\\nAudience:\\n Understanding the end audience for whom the research is being conducted is important as you consider how you present results. Some will want all the details, and others will simply want a recommendation. Failure to understand this end audience can result in the most eloquent of analyses failing to hit the mark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs you consider different approaches for your future research projects, I hope these thoughts help you decide whether that new analytical “handset” is truly necessary to meet your needs. Let me know your thoughts: send us a note.'}\n","{'Index': 145, 'Heading': '“Going Steady:” Lessons in Customer Loyalty from Romantic Relationship Research', 'Hyperlink': 'https://escalent.co/blog/going-steady-lessons-in-customer-loyalty-from-romantic-relationship-research/', 'Content': 'In my former life as an academic, I studied love. Well, romantic relationships, narrowly speaking. And I taught it too—every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8 am. Despite the early hour, every class was maxed out and, overall, exceptionally well-attended. While I’d like to attribute such high student engagement to my stellar teaching abilities, I know better: A class where you analyze nonverbal cues to assess another’s romantic interest, digest research on the “hook-up culture” and debate whether you should friend your ex on Facebook? What’s not to like?\\n\\n\\nThe Relational Investment Model\\n\\n\\nAlso covered in this class was a favorite model of mine: the (Original) Relational Investment Model (Rusbult, 1989). Here’s a quick recap, in case you slept through your own interpersonal communication class that day: High relationship satisfaction, high levels of investment and low quality of alternatives predict high relational commitment. Said another way, if your needs are being met in a relationship, you have already spent a lot of time or money to keep the relationship going and you don’t really have any other viable dating options at the moment, you’re more likely to stick it out with your current partner. Change any of the above equation, however, and level of commitment changes. (Insert your own example of a failed celebrity super couple here.)\\n\\n\\nThe XO’s of Business & Customer\\n\\n\\nWhen devising studies for our clients, particularly those centered on customer loyalty and retainment, I often find myself returning to this model and other related relational theories. Now, we often incorporate similar measures (e.g., customer satisfaction, \\nbrand awareness\\n), but overall the Relational Investment Model is an exceptionally useful framework for conceptualizing customer commitment. For instance, in the case of a “courtship” between Business X and Customer O, what “investments” does the customer currently make and how often? Has he invested a great deal of time into the relationship (e.g., tenure as a customer with Business X) or maybe Business X has already “met his family” (e.g., I’m thinking of family share plans in the \\ntelecommunications\\n space)? Does Customer O have a lot of potential alternatives he could “date,” with whom he is “compatible?”\\n\\n\\nThe model not only gives us a way to conceptualize customers’ current levels of commitment but also a way to potentially challenge those levels of commitment. Let’s say we know that Customer O’s commitment is low, but he is highly satisfied and has made tremendous investments in Business X.\\xa0 A likely culprit barring the door to increased commitment may be quality of alternatives. What other alternatives does Customer O have and, equally important, what can be done to derogate those alternatives? These and other questions offer a foundation for where and what to explore in hopes of improving Customer O’s commitment.\\n\\n\\nThe Social Effect\\n\\n\\nCertainly, the Relational Investment Model provides a unique lens through which to view the \\ncustomer-business relationship\\n. But, like most models, it’s not without limitations. For example, my research team is exploring how social media may factor into the equation (which, obviously, was not on Rusbult’s radar in 1989). With the ability to quickly bash or praise via Twitter or scope out competitors’ Facebook pages, it quickly becomes apparent that social media usage—of both businesses and customers—will impact satisfaction, investments and quality of alternatives, and, thus, tie to levels of customer commitment.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, the world of relational communication research is a rich resource for market researchers and savvy business people alike. It can inform so much of what we do and how we interact. And, who knows, maybe some of what we learn will brush off on our actual romantic relationships…\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWant to discuss?
