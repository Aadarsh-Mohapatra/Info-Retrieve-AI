Since it\\u2019s done on the category level, and not just for the brand, a company can find out where it\\u2019s performing well and discover new opportunities for growing its brand or market share.

In some cases, qualitative research conducted outside of the US (OUS) may be a lot like US research, but assuming that what works in the US is going to work well in other countries can result in a lot of unpleasant surprises.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor example, the first time I did research in India, I hadn\\u2019t arranged for a simultaneous translator because I assumed the respondents spoke English. They definitely did, but as the conversation during the focus group grew animated, they started lapsing into \\u201cHinglish,\\u201d switching between English and Hindi\\u2014sometimes even in the same sentence. I was totally lost. I learned that lesson quickly and had a simultaneous translator with me by the next day. But there are a lot of other things that I learned along the way, and I hope this blog post will spare you from making some of the same mistakes!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe meaning of \\u201con-time\\u201d interviews\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTake something as simple as the start and end times for a focus group. In the US, if the group is supposed to start at 6 pm, it generally starts somewhere around 6 pm\\u2014maybe a few minutes late but no big deal\\u2014and if it runs a little longer than the two hours planned, also usually no big deal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo, when your client arrives for a 6 pm focus group in a Latin American (LATAM) country, they may be expecting it to start at 6pm \\u2013 and then they start getting agitated when it\\u2019s 7 pm and still no signs of starting. I can count on one hand the number of times I\\u2019ve seen a focus group in Mexico or Brazil start even close to \\u201con time.\\u201d And if the topics aren\\u2019t all covered and the group is still talking two hours later, that\\u2019s usually fine, too\\u2026 especially since your 8 pm group isn\\u2019t going to start on time either. But in other markets like Germany and Japan, research starts and ends on time\\u2014to start late or keep a respondent over is unacceptably rude so you\\u2019d better be ready to start and finish right on time. Managing expectations ahead of time can help any agitation a client might feel about an interview that is starting \\u201clate\\u201d or is ended abruptly at the \\u201cend time.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour methodology might vary\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere have been a lot of advances in qualitative methodologies, and we\\u2019re able to conduct online research in a much wider range of countries than ever before, but the same rules don\\u2019t always apply internationally. Researchers and clients in the US love online bulletin boards for their ability to get a wide range of responses that can be probed in real time. But, unless your client is fluent in multiple languages, online bulletin boards outside of the US can\\u2019t be followed in real time\\u2014it is almost cost-prohibitive to follow them at all when you think about the translation costs for the huge amounts of data that an online bulletin board can generate. And in some cultures like Japan, it isn\\u2019t considered culturally appropriate to conduct research via online bulletin boards, as older generations prefer face to face and privacy concerns about sharing on the internet are prevalent.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOf course, there are workarounds like machine translation or having the analysis done in-country by a native speaker, but it\\u2019s something that has to be considered during the planning phase. The same can apply for telephone interviews\\u2014while US clients are used to being able to dial in and listen, simultaneous translation over a telephone can pose problems\\u2014not to mention the time difference: is someone really available at 4 am on a Saturday to listen live to physician research taking place in Japan (which often takes place over the weekend)?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn almost every market in the world, there\\u2019s a way to get the job done\\u2014it just might not be the same way as in the US\\u2014so being flexible with methodologies is important. I was once doing online bulletin boards in the US with women and teens on their face care routines\\u2014and in India, it turned out we had to do paper diaries. The research team in India had to hand-deliver each diary and then come back to the respondents\\u2019 homes to pick up the diaries a week later. It had been a while since I had even thought of paper diaries, but the results were just as rich and insightful!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs your 60-minute interview really 60 minutes?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe length of the interview is another consideration that often gets overlooked.

It had a market-representative sample of 9,396 respondents and included a survey that fielded from July to August 2022. Respondents were ages 18 to 80 with a primary vehicle model that\\u2019s 2016 or newer, and all intended to purchase a new vehicle within the next five years.\\\\xa0Data were weighted by age and gender to match the demographics of the new-vehicle buyer population and by vehicle segment to match current vehicle sales. The sample for this research comes from an opt-in, online panel. As such, any reported margins of error or significance tests are estimated and rely on the same statistical assumptions as data collected from a random probability sample. Escalent will supply the exact wording of any survey question upon request.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAfter two years of research, the total EVForward Europe sample now includes more than 19,000 new-car buyers across Europe, adding to the 30,000+ new-car buyers in the United States.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ground_truth\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 47,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"EVForward assists businesses in understanding the EV marketplace through audience segmentation and DeepDives.

In some cases, qualitative research conducted outside of the US (OUS) may be a lot like US research, but assuming that what works in the US is going to work well in other countries can result in a lot of unpleasant surprises.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor example, the first time I did research in India, I hadn\\u2019t arranged for a simultaneous translator because I assumed the respondents spoke English. They definitely did, but as the conversation during the focus group grew animated, they started lapsing into \\u201cHinglish,\\u201d switching between English and Hindi\\u2014sometimes even in the same sentence. I was totally lost. I learned that lesson quickly and had a simultaneous translator with me by the next day. But there are a lot of other things that I learned along the way, and I hope this blog post will spare you from making some of the same mistakes!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe meaning of \\u201con-time\\u201d interviews\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTake something as simple as the start and end times for a focus group. In the US, if the group is supposed to start at 6 pm, it generally starts somewhere around 6 pm\\u2014maybe a few minutes late but no big deal\\u2014and if it runs a little longer than the two hours planned, also usually no big deal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo, when your client arrives for a 6 pm focus group in a Latin American (LATAM) country, they may be expecting it to start at 6pm \\u2013 and then they start getting agitated when it\\u2019s 7 pm and still no signs of starting. I can count on one hand the number of times I\\u2019ve seen a focus group in Mexico or Brazil start even close to \\u201con time.\\u201d And if the topics aren\\u2019t all covered and the group is still talking two hours later, that\\u2019s usually fine, too\\u2026 especially since your 8 pm group isn\\u2019t going to start on time either. But in other markets like Germany and Japan, research starts and ends on time\\u2014to start late or keep a respondent over is unacceptably rude so you\\u2019d better be ready to start and finish right on time. Managing expectations ahead of time can help any agitation a client might feel about an interview that is starting \\u201clate\\u201d or is ended abruptly at the \\u201cend time.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour methodology might vary\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere have been a lot of advances in qualitative methodologies, and we\\u2019re able to conduct online research in a much wider range of countries than ever before, but the same rules don\\u2019t always apply internationally. Researchers and clients in the US love online bulletin boards for their ability to get a wide range of responses that can be probed in real time. But, unless your client is fluent in multiple languages, online bulletin boards outside of the US can\\u2019t be followed in real time\\u2014it is almost cost-prohibitive to follow them at all when you think about the translation costs for the huge amounts of data that an online bulletin board can generate. And in some cultures like Japan, it isn\\u2019t considered culturally appropriate to conduct research via online bulletin boards, as older generations prefer face to face and privacy concerns about sharing on the internet are prevalent.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOf course, there are workarounds like machine translation or having the analysis done in-country by a native speaker, but it\\u2019s something that has to be considered during the planning phase. The same can apply for telephone interviews\\u2014while US clients are used to being able to dial in and listen, simultaneous translation over a telephone can pose problems\\u2014not to mention the time difference: is someone really available at 4 am on a Saturday to listen live to physician research taking place in Japan (which often takes place over the weekend)?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn almost every market in the world, there\\u2019s a way to get the job done\\u2014it just might not be the same way as in the US\\u2014so being flexible with methodologies is important. I was once doing online bulletin boards in the US with women and teens on their face care routines\\u2014and in India, it turned out we had to do paper diaries. The research team in India had to hand-deliver each diary and then come back to the respondents\\u2019 homes to pick up the diaries a week later. It had been a while since I had even thought of paper diaries, but the results were just as rich and insightful!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs your 60-minute interview really 60 minutes?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe length of the interview is another consideration that often gets overlooked. What might be a 60-minute interview in the US is likely to last longer in other countries\\u2014just by nature of the other languages. Consider a standard introduction in English and how much longer those same words are when translated into German.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n']\",\n          \"['there\\u2019s an obstacle in my way\\\\n\\u2014\\\\nperhaps I shouldn\\u2019t have chosen this route.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAll these complex emotional interactions point to a need for astute support that reaches far beyond point-of-sale reassurances. The kind of support required by the person who has a sleepless night worrying about how to manage their 200-mile journey the next morning is different from the carpe diem mindset.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDelivering Multifaceted EV Support\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe critical support\\u2014via technology and traditional mediums\\u2014offered to EV buyers needs to become a multifaceted eco-structure that offers options for different consumer mindsets in different circumstances, so the EV user experience makes ownership \\\\n\\u201cEV easy!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe designed our EVForward Europe 2023 study, which is currently in field, to provide even deeper diagnostic perspective on both the user experience among EV owners as well as future EV adoption trends and desires.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\u2019re interested in learning more about our EVForward Europe findings and how we can help you refine your EV strategy, please reach out to us by clicking the button below.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAbout EVForward\\u2122 Europe 2022\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe second annual wave of the EVForward Europe study was conducted across five European countries: United Kingdom (n=1,941), Germany (n=2,011), France (n=1,723), Italy (n=1,915) and Spain (n=1,806). It had a market-representative sample of 9,396 respondents and included a survey that fielded from July to August 2022. Respondents were ages 18 to 80 with a primary vehicle model that\\u2019s 2016 or newer, and all intended to purchase a new vehicle within the next five years.\\\\xa0Data were weighted by age and gender to match the demographics of the new-vehicle buyer population and by vehicle segment to match current vehicle sales. The sample for this research comes from an opt-in, online panel. As such, any reported margins of error or significance tests are estimated and rely on the same statistical assumptions as data collected from a random probability sample. Escalent will supply the exact wording of any survey question upon request.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAfter two years of research, the total EVForward Europe sample now includes more than 19,000 new-car buyers across Europe, adding to the 30,000+ new-car buyers in the United States.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ground_truth\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 47,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"EVForward assists businesses in understanding the EV marketplace through audience segmentation and DeepDives.

Here are the factors that need consideration while conducting research in different countries:\\n\\n1. Language: The method of communication changes with the audience. For instance, in India, respondents might switch between English and Hindi during a discussion. It's essential to be prepared for language differences and arrange for translators if necessary.\\n\\n2. Cultural Considerations: In some countries, research starts and ends on time while in others, start and end times are not strictly adhered to. Therefore, managing expectations is key. Cultural values can also affect the medium of conducting research. For example, in Japan, due to privacy concerns, it isn't considered appropriate to conduct research via online bulletin boards.\\n\\n3. Technological Factors: Advances in technology have made online research possible in a lot more countries. However, the same rules don't always apply internationally. It can be expensive to follow online bulletin boards outside the US due to translation costs. Also, telephone interviews might not be feasible due to time zone differences and costs of simultaneous translation.\\n\\n4. Research Methodologies: Flexibility in methodologies is crucial. In the US, online bulletin boards might work. However, in countries like India, you might have to resort to traditional methods like paper diaries.\\n\\n5. Interview Timings: The length of the interview often gets overlooked. What might be a 60-minute interview in the US is likely to last longer in other countries\\u2014just by nature of the other languages. For instance, an English introduction translates longer in German. Building rapport in some countries is a slower process which adds to the length of the interview.\\n\\n6. Scheduling Norms: When research sessions take place can also greatly vary. For example, in Japan, sessions must be conducted in the evening or over the weekend because working respondents are not willing to miss work to participate in market research.\\n\\n7. Research Facilities: Research often takes place in atypical locations such as hotel meeting rooms or office buildings, rather than in traditional facilities with one-way mirrors. This can affect the logistics and cost of your research. \\n\\nAll these factors highlight the importance of careful planning and the need for flexibility when conducting international qualitative

      \"['With the improved quality of vehicles, technological advancements in automotive component systems, as well as smart manufacturing and better vehicle diagnostics we have seen over the past two decades, it is unsurprising that the average age of a passenger car in 2022 is \\\\n13.1 years\\\\n\\u2014four years older than in 2000. The average age of a light-duty truck is also up by three years, averaging \\\\n11.6 years\\\\n in operation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBased on an ongoing Escalent study exploring attitudes and behaviors of vehicle owners and intenders, there are several indicators that the upward trajectory in vehicle age may continue. This suggests there is significant potential for automotive dealers to lean into maintenance and repair offerings that can extend vehicle life spans, thereby further building a positive vehicle ownership experience and relationship with customers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFour Key Factors Driving Vehicle Age\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIncreasing Concern About Financial Future:\\\\n According to our study, more than half of consumers are less optimistic about the direction the United States is heading compared to a year ago, which is up from about one-third in 2019. Furthermore, more than one-quarter are less confident in maintaining their household income also compared to a year ago\\u2014up from 13% in 2019.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRising Vehicle Costs:\\\\n One-third of consumers who do not plan to acquire a vehicle in the next 12 months say they cannot afford to acquire a vehicle right now, and another one in seven says interest rates are too high. Meanwhile, new and used car prices are at record highs. Given the \\\\naverage sale price for a new car in December 2022\\\\n was $49,507\\u2014an almost 5% increase from the previous year\\u2014and the \\\\naverage used vehicle listing price\\\\n was $26,213 in March 2023, it is understandable that some consumers are not in a position to make such an investment in the short term. Furthermore, nearly two in ten survey respondents state that investing in a new vehicle is a poor value for the money right now.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChanging Vehicle Acquisition Plans:\\\\n With record-high transaction prices and an uncertain economy, almost three in ten vehicle intenders are postponing or abandoning their plans to acquire a vehicle.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaintaining Current Vehicles:\\\\n Instead of trading up, drivers are seeking ways to keep their vehicles on the road. Almost four in ten owners of a 2013 or older vehicle prefer to keep their older-model vehicle. The majority of these owners find automotive parts and accessories an easy and affordable way to keep their vehicle feeling new, increase the resale value and enhance safety\\u2014thus prolonging the viability of the vehicle and keeping it in operation longer.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpportunity for Dealers to Strengthen Customer Relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlthough car sales may be slowing, this constellation of factors presents a tremendous opportunity for dealers to further strengthen the relationship with their customers and sustain a positive vehicle ownership experience by leveraging the service department as a relevant and frequent touch point.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nService departments, traditionally, have not taken the lead with marketing and customer retention efforts. However, customers with a decade-plus aged vehicle will appreciate the proactive stance and commitment by dealers to help them preserve a vital asset, especially during volatile economic times.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe vehicle aging trend also presents an opportunity for dealers to explore emerging business models such as car sharing and car subscriptions. These alternatives to vehicle ownership may be a perfect fit for a customer who has an older vehicle where investing in repairs no longer makes good financial sense. These new business models also offer a recurring revenue stream for the dealer, which can be a strong motivating factor for adoption.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSupporting Vehicle Owners and Nurturing Brand Loyalty\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA lot has changed in the industry since 2000 when the average age of a vehicle was nine years and customer expectations were much more manageable.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt is important for dealers to review customer engagement strategies targeted at older-vehicle owners to ensure messaging encompasses a transition from solely preventative maintenance to maintenance and repair-or-replace. By doing so, dealerships can continue nurturing a positive relationship with owners of older vehicles and strengthen brand loyalty.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTo learn more about our findings or how we can help you best meet consumers\\u2019 needs, click the button below to send us a note.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAbout the Study\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of 1,020 consumers ages 18 and older from March 2, 2023 to March 24, 2023. Respondents were recruited from various opt-in online panels of US adults and were interviewed online. Demographic quotas of age, gender, ethnicity, and income were in place to represent the US adult population. As the sample for this research comes from an opt-in, online panel, any reported margins of error or significance tests are estimated and rely on the same statistical assumptions as data collected from a random probability sample. Escalent will supply the exact wording of any survey question upon request.']\",\n          \"['Since their inception, the biggest concern facing the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has been range capability. To this point, range has been the first drawback on everyone\\u2019s mind when it comes to EVs, from early adopters making due with the sub-100 mile ranges of the first available EVs to manufacturers downplaying the anxiety and racing to increase battery capacity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHowever, things are changing. Nearly 20 EVs on the market or available soon will boast ranges of 200 miles or more. While that\\u2019s still short of the average gas- or diesel-powered vehicle and such range anxiety won\\u2019t just disappear, it\\u2019s part of the reason EV-curious shoppers are looking past range to other concerns, like time spent at the charging station.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, consumer focus on fast charging has outpaced concerns over public charger availability, with Time Anxiety\\u2122 registering twice as important for an improved EV charging experience as the proximity of a charger to the driver\\u2019s route.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThose are some of our latest findings at Escalent thanks to a recent \\\\nEVForward\\u2122\\\\n DeepDive, which explored the considerations of EV shoppers across the broad adoption spectrum, from early adopters to those most wary and skeptical of the technology. And, it makes sense: an EV with comparable range to a traditional gas-powered vehicle that also requires a lengthy amount of time to refuel\\u2014several times longer than a stop at the gas pump\\u2014presents many of the same practicality concerns for shoppers as a vehicle with limited range in the first place.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo, while industry players\\u2014including manufacturers, regulators and utility companies, among others\\u2014are touting new partnerships and rapidly expanding charger networks, they\\u2019re not making the dent into the consideration barrier they want to make. Critically, they need to offer expansive charger networks that prioritize fast charging capabilities. Direct current (DC) fast charging is no longer a \\u201cnice-to-have\\u201d amenity, it\\u2019s a critical deal breaker for many consumers. Ultimately, shortening the time spent charging at a station effectively extends the range of the vehicle\\u2014at least, in the eyes of those shelling out their hard earned money on a new vehicle.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTo learn more about the findings from the latest EVForward\\u2122 DeepDive market report, click the button below to watch the 30-minute webinar replay where Automotive & Mobility vice president Mike Dovorany discusses Time Anxiety and several other topics, including the importance of home charging support and the impact of manufacturer warranties for EVs on adoption.']\",\n          \"[' marketers don\\u2019t see the value, or worse still, just don\\u2019t know how to do it. One of my client-partners recently captured her sponsorship challenges rather succinctly when she said:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cMost of us don\\u2019t even know where to start. Tallying of press coverage or social media buzz is just so cumbersome and doesn\\u2019t really give me anything meaningful. But if I do primary research with our target market, how do I tie that back into our brand research, or reliably link it to the measures that matter to my executives, like sales and profits?\\u201d \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith this frustration in mind, let\\u2019s take a look at the \\u201cwhy\\u201d and \\u201chow\\u201d of good sponsorship measurement.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhy You Need to Measure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMore than 100 US companies have sponsorship budgets in excess of $15 million, and the largest sponsors such as Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Nike and Anheuser-Busch spend well in excess of $200 million per annum. Given the size of these investments, the rationale for measurement should be obvious, and includes the following:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCorporate Governance:\\\\n Like any other company expenditure, the sponsorship spend needs to be clearly justified. So doing the research that identifies the causal links between the investment and corporate KPIs and/or financial returns is a critical corporate governance function that marketing is obliged to undertake.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProtect your Budget:\\\\n If you want to protect your sponsorship budget for next year, set about proving the value that it\\u2019s providing this year. Maintaining a consistent budget is particularly important for sponsorships associated with popular properties (e.g. NFL or MLB) where there are considerably more sponsors, many of whom might have been around for decades. In these instances, it may take years of investment to \\u201cbreak in\\u201d and gain consistent awareness and behavioral change with fans.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPrioritize Opportunities: \\\\nMost companies spread their budgets between a number of sponsorship properties in order to maximize reach or target disparate audiences. Effective measurement allows you to assess the relative merit of each sponsorship as it relates to corporate goals, allowing you to make informed decisions about which sponsorships to maintain and where to prioritize budget.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRenegotiation Power:\\\\n Perhaps the greatest value you\\u2019ll see from effective sponsorship measurement is when it comes to renegotiating your sponsorship contract. Having detailed data regarding what works best for your company provides you with far greater power, allowing you to focus on the opportunities that matter and negotiate a cost that you can confidently predict will deliver an ROI. I\\u2019ve recently witnessed a client-partner optimize the modules of their sponsorship with a major US sports league while saving nearly $10 million, all through having the right insights.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow You Should Measure Sponsorships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe \\u2018how\\u2019 is where most marketers get stuck, but, in fact, it\\u2019s relatively easy to get started with some fundamentals. The first step is to determine who is going to do the measurement, and if you\\u2019re looking for the data to deliver actionable insights and have credibility with your leadership, my strong recommendation is that you hire a team of independent professionals. Don\\u2019t let foxes into your henhouse.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe second step is to clearly define your audience on the front end. The audience definition should be relatively obvious\\u2014after all, you got into this sponsorship in the first place to reach a specific target segment. Perhaps you\\u2019re a tech brand looking to reach a senior business audience at a golf tournament, or maybe you\\u2019re an energy drinks brand that is looking to connect with Millennials by sponsoring a series of music concerts.\\\\xa0 Whatever the segment(s), have the demographic profile clearly defined up-front so you can zero in on the impact with the people that matter most to your brand.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBut don\\u2019t stop there. An even more crucial (but often overlooked) part of audience definition is fan classification, and specifically defining the \\u2018avidity\\u2019 of fans. Typically, you\\u2019ll want to define three fan classes:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAvid fans\\\\n who are deeply involved in the sponsorship property through regular attendance or viewership of events, as well as other engagement (e.g. online, social media)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCasual fans\\\\n who have more of a passing interest\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNon-fans\\\\n who have no interest at all\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUsing fan classes to break out different audience segments in your research will allow you to benchmark your impact based upon the level of engagement with the sponsorship property, see how closely your target market matches the fan base and, ultimately, measure the lift that is achieved over the general population.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTop Tip: Define Your Avid Fan Up-Front\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do you determine if a person is an \\u2018avid\\u2019 fan? The truth is, it can vary greatly from one sponsorship property to another.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ground_truth\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 46,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The advantages of widespread EV adoption include reducing reliance on fossil fuels, bettering the environment, and lower operating and maintenance costs.

One of the key hurdles is \\\"range anxiety\\\", where potential users are concerned about how far they can travel on a single charge. As per the context provided, only 8% of EV owners have completely run out of charge. Nonetheless, the fear of running out of power can be a deterrent to potential buyers. \\n\\nAnother significant obstacle is the availability and reliability of charging infrastructure. Even though home charging is preferred by EV owners, a robust public charging infrastructure is important both for easing range anxiety and facilitating longer trips. While charging infrastructure is improving, there is still a need for more availability, especially in rural and less heavily populated areas. A related challenge is the time it takes to charge an EV, which can significantly exceed the time it takes to refuel a gasoline vehicle, posing issues on longer trips.\\n\\nPrice can also be an obstacle. While the cost of EVs has been decreasing, they can still be more expensive upfront than comparable gasoline vehicles, although this can be offset by lower operating costs over time.\\n\\nThere are also consumer perceptions and a lack of awareness to tackle; consumers may not be aware of the realities of EV ownership, may not understand the technology or may have misconceptions that need to be addressed. For example, there's a stark disparity between the expectations and reality of living with an EV, both in terms of range anxiety and what it's actually like to own and operate these vehicles.
