In the US, if the group is supposed to start at 6 pm, it generally starts somewhere around 6 pm\\u2014maybe a few minutes late but no big deal\\u2014and if it runs a little longer than the two hours planned, also usually no big deal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo, when your client arrives for a 6 pm focus group in a Latin American (LATAM) country, they may be expecting it to start at 6pm \\u2013 and then they start getting agitated when it\\u2019s 7 pm and still no signs of starting. I can count on one hand the number of times I\\u2019ve seen a focus group in Mexico or Brazil start even close to \\u201con time.\\u201d And if the topics aren\\u2019t all covered and the group is still talking two hours later, that\\u2019s usually fine, too\\u2026 especially since your 8 pm group isn\\u2019t going to start on time either. But in other markets like Germany and Japan, research starts and ends on time\\u2014to start late or keep a respondent over is unacceptably rude so you\\u2019d better be ready to start and finish right on time. Managing expectations ahead of time can help any agitation a client might feel about an interview that is starting \\u201clate\\u201d or is ended abruptly at the \\u201cend time.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour methodology might vary\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere have been a lot of advances in qualitative methodologies, and we\\u2019re able to conduct online research in a much wider range of countries than ever before, but the same rules don\\u2019t always apply internationally. Researchers and clients in the US love online bulletin boards for their ability to get a wide range of responses that can be probed in real time. But, unless your client is fluent in multiple languages, online bulletin boards outside of the US can\\u2019t be followed in real time\\u2014it is almost cost-prohibitive to follow them at all when you think about the translation costs for the huge amounts of data that an online bulletin board can generate. And in some cultures like Japan, it isn\\u2019t considered culturally appropriate to conduct research via online bulletin boards, as older generations prefer face to face and privacy concerns about sharing on the internet are prevalent.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOf course, there are workarounds like machine translation or having the analysis done in-country by a native speaker, but it\\u2019s something that has to be considered during the planning phase. The same can apply for telephone interviews\\u2014while US clients are used to being able to dial in and listen, simultaneous translation over a telephone can pose problems\\u2014not to mention the time difference: is someone really available at 4 am on a Saturday to listen live to physician research taking place in Japan (which often takes place over the weekend)?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn almost every market in the world, there\\u2019s a way to get the job done\\u2014it just might not be the same way as in the US\\u2014so being flexible with methodologies is important. I was once doing online bulletin boards in the US with women and teens on their face care routines\\u2014and in India, it turned out we had to do paper diaries. The research team in India had to hand-deliver each diary and then come back to the respondents\\u2019 homes to pick up the diaries a week later. It had been a while since I had even thought of paper diaries, but the results were just as rich and insightful!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs your 60-minute interview really 60 minutes?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe length of the interview is another consideration that often gets overlooked. What might be a 60-minute interview in the US is likely to last longer in other countries\\u2014just by nature of the other languages. Consider a standard introduction in English and how much longer those same words are when translated into German.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n']\",\n          \"['there\\u2019s an obstacle in my way\\\\n\\u2014\\\\nperhaps I shouldn\\u2019t have chosen this route.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAll these complex emotional interactions point to a need for astute support that reaches far beyond point-of-sale reassurances. The kind of support required by the person who has a sleepless night worrying about how to manage their 200-mile journey the next morning is different from the carpe diem mindset.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDelivering Multifaceted EV Support\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe critical support\\u2014via technology and traditional mediums\\u2014offered to EV buyers needs to become a multifaceted eco-structure that offers options for different consumer mindsets in different circumstances, so the EV user experience makes ownership \\\\n\\u201cEV easy!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe designed our EVForward Europe 2023 study, which is currently in field, to provide even deeper diagnostic perspective on both the user experience among EV owners as well as future EV adoption trends and desires.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\u2019re interested in learning more about our EVForward Europe findings and how we can help you refine your EV strategy, please reach out to us by clicking the button below.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAbout EVForward\\u2122 Europe 2022\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe second annual wave of the EVForward Europe study was conducted across five European countries: United Kingdom (n=1,941), Germany (n=2,011), France (n=1,723), Italy (n=1,915) and Spain (n=1,806). It had a market-representative sample of 9,396 respondents and included a survey that fielded from July to August 2022. Respondents were ages 18 to 80 with a primary vehicle model that\\u2019s 2016 or newer, and all intended to purchase a new vehicle within the next five years.\\\\xa0Data were weighted by age and gender to match the demographics of the new-vehicle buyer population and by vehicle segment to match current vehicle sales. The sample for this research comes from an opt-in, online panel. As such, any reported margins of error or significance tests are estimated and rely on the same statistical assumptions as data collected from a random probability sample. Escalent will supply the exact wording of any survey question upon request.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAfter two years of research, the total EVForward Europe sample now includes more than 19,000 new-car buyers across Europe, adding to the 30,000+ new-car buyers in the United States.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ground_truth\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 47,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"EVForward assists businesses in understanding the EV marketplace through audience segmentation and DeepDives.

In some cases, qualitative research conducted outside of the US (OUS) may be a lot like US research, but assuming that what works in the US is going to work well in other countries can result in a lot of unpleasant surprises.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor example, the first time I did research in India, I hadn\\u2019t arranged for a simultaneous translator because I assumed the respondents spoke English. They definitely did, but as the conversation during the focus group grew animated, they started lapsing into \\u201cHinglish,\\u201d switching between English and Hindi\\u2014sometimes even in the same sentence. I was totally lost. I learned that lesson quickly and had a simultaneous translator with me by the next day. But there are a lot of other things that I learned along the way, and I hope this blog post will spare you from making some of the same mistakes!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe meaning of \\u201con-time\\u201d interviews\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTake something as simple as the start and end times for a focus group. In the US, if the group is supposed to start at 6 pm, it generally starts somewhere around 6 pm\\u2014maybe a few minutes late but no big deal\\u2014and if it runs a little longer than the two hours planned, also usually no big deal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo, when your client arrives for a 6 pm focus group in a Latin American (LATAM) country, they may be expecting it to start at 6pm \\u2013 and then they start getting agitated when it\\u2019s 7 pm and still no signs of starting. I can count on one hand the number of times I\\u2019ve seen a focus group in Mexico or Brazil start even close to \\u201con time.\\u201d And if the topics aren\\u2019t all covered and the group is still talking two hours later, that\\u2019s usually fine, too\\u2026 especially since your 8 pm group isn\\u2019t going to start on time either. But in other markets like Germany and Japan, research starts and ends on time\\u2014to start late or keep a respondent over is unacceptably rude so you\\u2019d better be ready to start and finish right on time. Managing expectations ahead of time can help any agitation a client might feel about an interview that is starting \\u201clate\\u201d or is ended abruptly at the \\u201cend time.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour methodology might vary\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere have been a lot of advances in qualitative methodologies, and we\\u2019re able to conduct online research in a much wider range of countries than ever before, but the same rules don\\u2019t always apply internationally. Researchers and clients in the US love online bulletin boards for their ability to get a wide range of responses that can be probed in real time. But, unless your client is fluent in multiple languages, online bulletin boards outside of the US can\\u2019t be followed in real time\\u2014it is almost cost-prohibitive to follow them at all when you think about the translation costs for the huge amounts of data that an online bulletin board can generate. And in some cultures like Japan, it isn\\u2019t considered culturally appropriate to conduct research via online bulletin boards, as older generations prefer face to face and privacy concerns about sharing on the internet are prevalent.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOf course, there are workarounds like machine translation or having the analysis done in-country by a native speaker, but it\\u2019s something that has to be considered during the planning phase. The same can apply for telephone interviews\\u2014while US clients are used to being able to dial in and listen, simultaneous translation over a telephone can pose problems\\u2014not to mention the time difference: is someone really available at 4 am on a Saturday to listen live to physician research taking place in Japan (which often takes place over the weekend)?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn almost every market in the world, there\\u2019s a way to get the job done\\u2014it just might not be the same way as in the US\\u2014so being flexible with methodologies is important. I was once doing online bulletin boards in the US with women and teens on their face care routines\\u2014and in India, it turned out we had to do paper diaries. The research team in India had to hand-deliver each diary and then come back to the respondents\\u2019 homes to pick up the diaries a week later. It had been a while since I had even thought of paper diaries, but the results were just as rich and insightful!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs your 60-minute interview really 60 minutes?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe length of the interview is another consideration that often gets overlooked. What might be a 60-minute interview in the US is likely to last longer in other countries\\u2014just by nature of the other languages. Consider a standard introduction in English and how much longer those same words are when translated into German.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n']\",\n          \"['there\\u2019s an obstacle in my way\\\\n\\u2014\\\\nperhaps I shouldn\\u2019t have chosen this route.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAll these complex emotional interactions point to a need for astute support that reaches far beyond point-of-sale reassurances.

It had a market-representative sample of 9,396 respondents and included a survey that fielded from July to August 2022. Respondents were ages 18 to 80 with a primary vehicle model that\\u2019s 2016 or newer, and all intended to purchase a new vehicle within the next five years.\\\\xa0Data were weighted by age and gender to match the demographics of the new-vehicle buyer population and by vehicle segment to match current vehicle sales. The sample for this research comes from an opt-in, online panel. As such, any reported margins of error or significance tests are estimated and rely on the same statistical assumptions as data collected from a random probability sample. Escalent will supply the exact wording of any survey question upon request.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAfter two years of research, the total EVForward Europe sample now includes more than 19,000 new-car buyers across Europe, adding to the 30,000+ new-car buyers in the United States.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ground_truth\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 47,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"EVForward assists businesses in understanding the EV marketplace through audience segmentation and DeepDives.

Here are the factors that need consideration while conducting research in different countries:\\n\\n1. Language: The method of communication changes with the audience. For instance, in India, respondents might switch between English and Hindi during a discussion. It's essential to be prepared for language differences and arrange for translators if necessary.\\n\\n2. Cultural Considerations: In some countries, research starts and ends on time while in others, start and end times are not strictly adhered to. Therefore, managing expectations is key. Cultural values can also affect the medium of conducting research. For example, in Japan, due to privacy concerns, it isn't considered appropriate to conduct research via online bulletin boards.\\n\\n3. Technological Factors: Advances in technology have made online research possible in a lot more countries. However, the same rules don't always apply internationally. It can be expensive to follow online bulletin boards outside the US due to translation costs. Also, telephone interviews might not be feasible due to time zone differences and costs of simultaneous translation.\\n\\n4. Research Methodologies: Flexibility in methodologies is crucial. In the US, online bulletin boards might work. However, in countries like India, you might have to resort to traditional methods like paper diaries.\\n\\n5. Interview Timings: The length of the interview often gets overlooked. What might be a 60-minute interview in the US is likely to last longer in other countries\\u2014just by nature of the other languages. For instance, an English introduction translates longer in German. Building rapport in some countries is a slower process which adds to the length of the interview.\\n\\n6. Scheduling Norms: When research sessions take place can also greatly vary. For example, in Japan, sessions must be conducted in the evening or over the weekend because working respondents are not willing to miss work to participate in market research.\\n\\n7. Research Facilities: Research often takes place in atypical locations such as hotel meeting rooms or office buildings, rather than in traditional facilities with one-way mirrors. This can affect the logistics and cost of your research. \\n\\nAll these factors highlight the importance of careful planning and the need for flexibility when conducting international qualitative
