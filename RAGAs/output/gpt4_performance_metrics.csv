What challenges do auto manufacturers face in response to potential massive price hikes due to trade tariffs?,"['In both the UK and US, there is currently a real risk for political dynamics to result in the imposition of trade tariffs that have selective, disruptive effects on various product categories.\n\n\nTraditionally, vehicle manufacturers have been able to introduce modest price rises almost indiscernibly. Sometimes, currency fluctuations may also serve to inflate prices but, critically, neither mechanism tends to disrupt the pricing hierarchy.\n\n\nIf sizeable tariffs are applied to vehicle brands from specific countries or regions, there is potential for the pricing hierarchy of brands to be massively disrupted.\n\n\nSo, how might car buyers react to massive overnight price hikes for various car brands? We conducted a small scale, attitudinal study in the UK and US to determine what car buyers would actually do in various scenarios.\n\n\nIt is clear in both countries that, faced with a discernibly higher price, car buyer behaviour would scatter in all sorts of different directions. In the UK, only 17% of car buyers would stick with their original make/model preference. A further one third would likely stay with their preferred brand but also seek a means of mitigating the price increase by down-grading on trim levels or segment. With one quarter delaying the time of purchase and another 14% intending to switch brand, it can be seen that close to 40% of buyers would adopt a behaviour that would deliver the most disruptive outcome for their preferred brand.\n\n\nIn the US, the impact of the significant price increases would be even more disruptive—27% would delay the purchase while 37% would switch brand, either within the same segment or down-grading.\n\n\nWhile the UK responses were in reaction to a 20% price increase, the results indicate that US car buyers are particularly price sensitive—over 20% would react in response to a 5% increase while a further 50% would feel the need to re-appraise their vehicle choice if the price hike hit the 15% threshold.\n\n\nSo, What Does This Mean for Auto Manufacturers?\n\n\nSevere price increases imposed via tariffs that brands have no control over create massive market challenges. Margins are already incredibly tight, so significant discounting is akin to commercial self-harming. Promotion of different ownership models may represent a medium to long-term means of mitigating some of these effects.\n\n\nFor any car buyer, there is always a personal value for “money equation” to be satisfied—in other words, balancing what the buyer gets for what they have to pay for it. While geo-politics might influence the “pay” side of the equation, manufacturers can always influence the “what the buyer gets” element by ensuring they build as much equity as they can into their make/model proposition. This translates into ensuring that, through all forms of marketing communications, manufacturers sharply focus on projecting to potential consumers the most influential and resonating benefits that are present in both the brand and the models.\n\n\nThere is never a bad time to reinforce the equity in a brand or its vehicles—but at a time when there is a risk of disruptive pricing, it becomes even more imperative.\n\n\nOur \nAutomotive & Mobility\n team is deeply embedded in the global auto industry as it undergoes ever-growing disruption and transformation. \nFeel free to send us a note with your questions and challenges—we can help you get ahead of the curve of this dynamic market.\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nThis blog post references data from two Escalent studies. In one, Escalent interviewed a US-based sample of 998 consumers aged 18 and up in October 2019, of which 901 intend to purchase/lease a vehicle in the future.\xa0Respondents were recruited from the Dynata and Ipsos panels of US adults and were interviewed online.\xa0Quotas were put in place to achieve a sample of age, gender, income, and ethnicity that matches the demographics of the US population.\xa0In the other, Escalent interviewed a UK-based sample of 293 consumers in October 2019 who had bought/leased a passenger vehicle in the last\xa0three years (all passenger vehicle brands and segments were included).\xa0Respondents were recruited from the Dynata and Toluna panels of UK adults and were interviewed online.\xa0Due to their opt-in nature, these online panels (like most others) do not yield a random probability sample of the target population.\xa0As such, it is not possible to compute a margin of error or to statistically quantify the accuracy of projections.

Tenants, however, find this charging style the least appealing. This may present a problem if tenants find power sharing untenable when owning an EV.\n\n\nTwo Important Lessons on EV Charging Infrastructure for Multifamily Housing EV Owners\n\n\nBased on these findings, solving charging for multifamily housing EV owners is not the barrier that many stakeholders believe it is.\n\n\nHowever, it’s also not a fully solved problem and will require further attention from automakers, utilities and policymakers to ensure that multifamily housing residents can participate in and benefit from the e-mobility transition. In this vein, we can learn two main lessons from these findings:\n\n\nLesson 1:\n Continuing to invest in public infrastructure is essential. But it’s not enough to have the infrastructure in place if it’s not visible. Anyone installing charging infrastructure needs to ensure that it’s placed in a visible location and that it has eye-catching branding—avoid the “beige box!” Public infrastructure gives car buyers, regardless of where they live, confidence that they can get a charge when they need it and may play a crucial role in how multifamily housing residents charge.\n\n\nLesson 2:\n Landlords face a balancing act in installing infrastructure for their residents. Tenants who own an EV want a dedicated place to plug in their vehicle, but provisioning dedicated plugs in large parking lots or garages is expensive and risks incurring significant demand charges from the electric utility. Landlords will need to develop phasing plans that allow them to build infrastructure as EV ownership among their tenants grows organically and these plans should include discussion with their utility about ensuring sufficient electric charging capability.\n\n\nFor more details on how multifamily housing residents and their landlords are thinking about EV charging, click below to discover more about our \nEVs for EVeryone\n report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nAbout the EVs for EVeryone Study\n\n\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of 15,553 consumers age 18 to 99 between June 23 and August 24, 2023.

How can effective sponsorship measurement help in renegotiating sponsorship contracts?,"[' marketers don’t see the value, or worse still, just don’t know how to do it. One of my client-partners recently captured her sponsorship challenges rather succinctly when she said:\n\n\n“Most of us don’t even know where to start. Tallying of press coverage or social media buzz is just so cumbersome and doesn’t really give me anything meaningful. But if I do primary research with our target market, how do I tie that back into our brand research, or reliably link it to the measures that matter to my executives, like sales and profits?” \n\n\nWith this frustration in mind, let’s take a look at the “why” and “how” of good sponsorship measurement.\n\n\nWhy You Need to Measure\n\n\nMore than 100 US companies have sponsorship budgets in excess of $15 million, and the largest sponsors such as Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Nike and Anheuser-Busch spend well in excess of $200 million per annum. Given the size of these investments, the rationale for measurement should be obvious, and includes the following:\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Governance:\n Like any other company expenditure, the sponsorship spend needs to be clearly justified. So doing the research that identifies the causal links between the investment and corporate KPIs and/or financial returns is a critical corporate governance function that marketing is obliged to undertake.\n\n\nProtect your Budget:\n If you want to protect your sponsorship budget for next year, set about proving the value that it’s providing this year. Maintaining a consistent budget is particularly important for sponsorships associated with popular properties (e.g. NFL or MLB) where there are considerably more sponsors, many of whom might have been around for decades. In these instances, it may take years of investment to “break in” and gain consistent awareness and behavioral change with fans.\n\n\nPrioritize Opportunities: \nMost companies spread their budgets between a number of sponsorship properties in order to maximize reach or target disparate audiences. Effective measurement allows you to assess the relative merit of each sponsorship as it relates to corporate goals, allowing you to make informed decisions about which sponsorships to maintain and where to prioritize budget.\n\n\nRenegotiation Power:\n Perhaps the greatest value you’ll see from effective sponsorship measurement is when it comes to renegotiating your sponsorship contract. Having detailed data regarding what works best for your company provides you with far greater power, allowing you to focus on the opportunities that matter and negotiate a cost that you can confidently predict will deliver an ROI. I’ve recently witnessed a client-partner optimize the modules of their sponsorship with a major US sports league while saving nearly $10 million, all through having the right insights.\n\n\n\n\nHow You Should Measure Sponsorships\n\n\nThe ‘how’ is where most marketers get stuck, but, in fact, it’s relatively easy to get started with some fundamentals. The first step is to determine who is going to do the measurement, and if you’re looking for the data to deliver actionable insights and have credibility with your leadership, my strong recommendation is that you hire a team of independent professionals. Don’t let foxes into your henhouse.\n\n\nThe second step is to clearly define your audience on the front end. The audience definition should be relatively obvious—after all, you got into this sponsorship in the first place to reach a specific target segment. Perhaps you’re a tech brand looking to reach a senior business audience at a golf tournament, or maybe you’re an energy drinks brand that is looking to connect with Millennials by sponsoring a series of music concerts.\xa0 Whatever the segment(s), have the demographic profile clearly defined up-front so you can zero in on the impact with the people that matter most to your brand.\n\n\nBut don’t stop there. An even more crucial (but often overlooked) part of audience definition is fan classification, and specifically defining the ‘avidity’ of fans. Typically, you’ll want to define three fan classes:\n\n\n\n\nAvid fans\n who are deeply involved in the sponsorship property through regular attendance or viewership of events, as well as other engagement (e.g. online, social media)\n\n\nCasual fans\n who have more of a passing interest\n\n\nNon-fans\n who have no interest at all\n\n\n\n\nUsing fan classes to break out different audience segments in your research will allow you to benchmark your impact based upon the level of engagement with the sponsorship property, see how closely your target market matches the fan base and, ultimately, measure the lift that is achieved over the general population.\n\n\n\n\nTop Tip: Define Your Avid Fan Up-Front\n\n\nHow do you determine if a person is an ‘avid’ fan? The truth is, it can vary greatly from one sponsorship property to another.']","Effective sponsorship measurement provides detailed data regarding what works best for a company, allowing them to have greater power in renegotiating sponsorship contracts.

What is the current availability of charging stations for electric vehicles in the United States?,"['EV Potential Not Yet Realized\n\n\nAs we look back on the past decade, I think most of us would acknowledge that it has been a period of tremendous business innovation and industry disruption, whether that be Uber and Lyft upending the taxicab industry, Airbnb undercutting the hotel industry, or streaming video services that have caused consumers to abandon cable and satellite services.\n\n\nIn the coming decade, it seems clear that another industry that will undergo tremendous change is the automotive industry. In particular, auto manufacturers have already started to embrace and invest in technology that will profoundly affect the industry, transportation infrastructure and on consumers themselves: electric vehicles (EVs).\n\n\nThe potential benefits of EVs are numerous and important. Given the increasing threats of climate change, EVs represent a critical step in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and in bettering our environment. In addition, EVs will provide consumers with lower operating and maintenance costs as compared to conventional vehicles.\n\n\nAt the same time, the trade-offs and barriers to EV adoption are also significant. Range anxiety (i.e., the worry that an EV won’t travel a sufficient distance on a single charge) has been a consistent concern of consumers since EVs’ inception. Additionally, even with the fastest chargers, charging times far exceed the five minutes it takes to fill up the gas tank of vehicles with internal combustion engines. Furthermore, while the number of public charging stations has increased significantly over time, they are still limited in number and would likely be insufficient to meet any major, short-term spike in EVs on the road.\n\n\nAuto\n manufacturers and \ntech\n firms have been working hard to reduce these barriers. Batteries and electronics design have improved to the point where some of the latest models tout driving ranges of nearly 400 miles. Apps are now available to identify the location and availability of public charging stations. Public fast-charging stations are now able to recharge up to 80% of a vehicle’s battery in 30 minutes, and various organizations are working on initiatives to reduce charging times further.\n\n\nWhile the adoption of EVs has grown over time, \nEV sales in the US still represent less than 2%\n of the total vehicle market. So, with all of these improvements and the environmental and cost benefits of EVs, why haven’t EV sales been booming? In addition, have tech initiatives really overcome the EV barriers they set out to address? I have some opinions based on my own experience.\n\n\nFunctional Benefits Aren’t Always Enough\n\n\nWhen conducting consumer interviews last year on a wide range of topics including the steps that consumers would willingly take to combat climate change, I asked about the appeal of EVs. Most respondents were notably lukewarm to the general category, yet immediately added as an afterthought, “Now Tesla. That’s an EV that I could get excited about!” In probing further, the interest in Tesla wasn’t based so much on its environmental benefits, but rather its sleek, sexy styling and “cool” image. Given that the styling and image are combined with impressive battery \ntechnology\n and a host of tech features, it is little wonder that Tesla has dominated the US EV market.\n\n\nThe Chevy Bolt is the second most popular EV in the US, but still suffered an almost 9% drop in sales this past year. \n\xa0In its marketing materials, Chevy emphasizes the Bolt’s impressive driving range, low cost of ownership, safety and several other features. My middle brother, a proud Chevy Bolt owner, validates that these claims are true, but he also stresses an emotional benefit that Chevy fails to tout: the Bolt \nis fun to drive\n. With much more torque than internal combustion engines, the Bolt (and EVs in general) can accelerate faster, which makes merging with and maneuvering around traffic easier and more enjoyable. Yet, when it comes to marketing, Chevy appears to be promoting the Bolt on its functional and practical merits only rather than including an appeal to any emotional motivators (i.e., being fun to drive).\n\n\nCharging: Not as Simple as it Seems\n\n\nA little over a year ago, my Chevy Bolt-owning brother decided that he wanted to see if we could make the drive from the San Francisco Bay Area to Lake Tahoe. Knowing that the Bolt couldn’t reach the destination on a single charge, my brother’s first task was to figure out where one could find charging stations along the way. So, unlike traveling in a conventional vehicle with easy access to ubiquitous gas stations along the way, it became clear that EV charging would be more challenging because it involves up-front planning (e.g., knowing how far your vehicle can go, where charging stations are located, and being smart about when to stop to recharge).\n\n\nAfter mapping out the trip and checking his charging station app, my brother came up with a plan to drive to a station about halfway to our destination.

How is the global rideshare industry projected to grow in the coming years?,"['It’s safe to say that ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft are an integral part of the automotive and mobility landscape as the global rideshare industry is projected to grow from $51B in 2017 to over $220B by 2025. Ridesharing has become a reliable and relatively safe option for out-of-town business and vacation travel, getting around locally, or simply when in a pinch. A growing number of consumers, especially in urban markets, are even opting to forego private vehicle ownership altogether given the convenience of summoning a rideshare service with the push of a button on a phone app. The appeal of no parking, insurance, fuel, maintenance and, of course, personal responsibility has won over many, even if the collective economics and other conveniences aren’t in favor of ridesharing when traveling a significant number of miles each year.\n\n\nBased on our June-July 2019 Escalent Automotive Consumer Pulse Study, an online survey* conducted monthly among approximately 1,000 US adults 18 years of age and older, one-third of the US adult population are already using rideshare services to varying degrees. Nearly half of these riders have an experience with a rideshare provider at least monthly, which translates to a significant cross-section of exposure to automotive brands. But do these rides have an impact on how consumers perceive automotive brands? Or, perhaps better asked, CAN these rides have an impact on automotive brand perceptions?\n\n\n\n\nRidesharing to Increase Vehicle Sales\n\n\nThere’s plenty of debate around predictions of the impact of ridesharing on new vehicle sales. While an increasing number of consumers may avoid car ownership, the \noverall vehicle-miles traveled will likely not decline\n and are projected to potentially increase as new audiences–such as elderly or disabled people–have growing access to this game-changing mobility option. Therefore, given the faster rate at which miles accumulate, we expect that rideshare vehicle replacement will be on a shorter time cycle than privately-owned vehicles. The need or desire for new technology and vehicle features may also trigger rideshare vehicle owners to purchase new cars sooner, in order to avoid varying degrees of vehicle obsolescence. Rideshare volume (miles driven) is also taking away from traditional mass transit options (such as subway, bus, shuttle, light rail) and, of course, has significantly up-ended the taxi and rental car industry–all supporting the potential for increased vehicle sales.\n\n\nBranding Opportunities with Rideshare Riders\n\n\nWhile the potential for increased new car sales due to ridesharing sounds like a windfall for OEMs, the \nrole of the brand\n itself has the potential to be diluted and considered a commodity to end users of ridesharing services, especially since riders don’t typically have a choice of brand. We dug into this in our study and asked participants about the importance of various aspects of ridesharing. It turns out that the “brand” of rideshare vehicle falls low on the importance continuum for riders when asked how important which brand or model of vehicle picks them up, so long as it is on time and meets their size needs. More than 3 out of 5 people indicated they have no preference at all which brand of vehicle they ride in.\n\n\n\n\nThis may seem like counterbalancing bad news for carmakers. However, this can also be interpreted as an opportunity for automotive manufacturers to create a brand impression and experience with as much as one third of the population. This is a significant, captive audience to engage as future prospects and brand advocates, albeit predominantly from the back seat. Rideshare users represent a sizable and growing target audience that marketers should be clamoring to engage using both subtle and overt cues–particularly in models that lend themselves to rideshare usage.\n\n\nRideshare Branding Recommendations\n\n\nRiders, of course, will have preoccupations during their ride other than observing the vehicle they’re in. However, OEMs have the opportunity to help riders take notice of the vehicle they are riding in, and create or change their brand perceptions. Delivering or conveying the highest order needs, such as safety, quality, harmony, and comfort (seat comfort, ride comfort, legroom, comfort of entry, noise, and climate) will leave riders feeling that the vehicle brand can be trusted and is a leader – and may even pleasantly surprise riders. Providing personalization, such as individual climate control, infotainment options, and other connected features, signals a brand that delivers more than expected. Perhaps the most overlooked opportunity is the presence of branding itself with placement of brand logos and naming to reinforce which brand of vehicle riders are experiencing. Having rideshare drivers who are advocates for the vehicle brand would be an added bonus, and might be had for little or no additional cost.\n\n\nAdmittedly, investing in rear seat appointments runs counterintuitive with typical vehicle usage patterns for some classes of privately-owned vehicles; but the stakes are high']",The global rideshare industry is projected to grow from $51B in 2017 to over $220B by 2025.,simple,"[{'title': 'Rideshare Vehicles: A Meaningful Brand Target for Automotive OEMs', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/rideshare-vehicles-a-meaningful-brand-target-for-automotive-oems/'}]",True,The global rideshare industry is projected to grow from $51B in 2017 to over $220B by 2025.,"['the', 'global', 'rideshare', 'industry', 'is', 'projected', 'to', 'grow', 'from', '$', '51b', 'in', '2017', 'to', 'over', '$', '220b', 'by', '2025', '.']","['the', 'global', 'rideshare', 'industry', 'is', 'projected', 'to', 'grow', 'from', '$', '51b', 'in', '2017', 'to', 'over', '$', '220b', 'by', '2025', '.']",1.0,0.999999995,0.9999999,0.9999999,0.9999999,"Delivering multifaceted EV support to EV buyers is important because it provides options for different consumer mindsets in different circumstances, thus making the EV user experience easier and enticing ownership.

"What are some of the specific areas that manufacturers, suppliers, and technology companies are focusing on in order to lead the reinvention of the automobile?","['For fans of the Terminator series of movies, it was compelling to think about a world that would foster “The Rise of the Machines.”\n\n\nFor consumers today – living in a switched-on world where the once-impossible is now a foregone conclusion – a profound, shape-shifting change is underway – one that we will call, “The Rise of the Smart Car.”\n\n\nFor those who have experienced the “tip of the iceberg” innovations in today’s currently-available models, it’s easy to see how the continued evolution of automated features, connectedness and yet-to-be-scoped technology will portend a future that is not that far off.\n\n\nAs we walked the floor of the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we gasped at the surreal experience before us. No longer did we see cars, as we, for generations, have come to experience them. Replacing the four wheels and a box were a dizzying array of form factors – designed more to contain, and define, a future driving experience where the exterior is not nearly as relevant as what lives inside. Changeable seats, in-car virtual reality, and holographic systems are among the newest innovations, jockeying to advance the traveling transformation underway.\n\n\nAnother reality that quickly unfolded as we walked the CES: There’s not one universal standard for the smart cars of the future. And, likewise, there’s no universal agreement on what the future “device” should look like. Beyond agreeing that electrification, connectivity, shared mobility and autonomy are the foundation, there’s no unifying approach that would dictate things like how many screens are enough (or too much), what the interior should look like, or how pervasive these connected car systems should be during the driving experience.\n\n\nThis makes it even more imperative that manufacturers, designers and others who earn their salt from the automotive industry, gain a keen understanding of where the motoring future is headed – and to embrace an ideal in which the car will be at the center of how we travel or experience seamless mobility.\n\n\n\n\n“The Car, As We Know It, Is Dead.”\n\n\nThis change from what we have accepted as a “car,” is a movie that we’ve seen before (and, by this, we do not mean a Hollywood production). For the longest time, the phone was a clearly defined object – a box with 12 buttons, a handset and a cord. For generations, there was little debate as to what the phone should look like. Then, at some point, the cord was cut – and the world went crazy. No longer could we envision what the future of the phone would look like. Experimenters tried approaches that eliminated some – or all – of the telephone’s sacred cows – buttons, dials, handsets and cords.\n\n\nToday, the device we hold – the smartphone – is the result of a tumultuous sea of change in the phone segment. And the “phone” itself – the enablement of point-to-point voice communication – is relegated to a single button on a screen with endless communication choices.\n\n\n\n\nSo can we expect that, in similar fashion, the core function of the car – to deliver people and parcels from Point A to Point B – will simply be an item on a long list of what the “smartcar” of the future can do?\n\n\nLet’s explore in more detail by looking at some themes that were emerging as we absorbed the CES.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nMega Trends Are Alive and Well\n\n\n\n\nPersonalization – \nThough we can program our favorite waypoints and radio stations in today’s vehicles, consumers – accustomed to downloading whatever apps they desire to their smartphones – will be demanding much greater personalization in the vehicle of the future. Customization of physical and sensory aspects (such as interior lighting and sound), connected services (both remote and in-vehicle), and virtual personal assistants that connect us to the car and to other devices, lead the list.\n\n\nExperience – \nAcquiring possessions is losing ground to the appreciation of an experience. In vehicles, this is manifesting itself by making driving less of the focus, while offering new functions with benefits, such as enhanced comfort, entertainment and productivity – many of which will be available “on demand” to the consumer, through subscription services.\n\n\nSharing – \nConsumers share more than ever before, both actively (e.g., Facebook) and passively (e.g., location-based apps). Vehicles are joining the fray as sharing becomes not only a common trend, but also a way of accelerating future product developments (i.e. open platforms).\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nThe Automobile Reinvention is Under Way\n\n\nIn order to lead this reinvention, manufacturers, suppliers and technology companies are focusing on four specific areas:\n\n']","Manufacturers, suppliers, and technology companies are focusing on personalization, experience, sharing, and connectivity in order to lead the reinvention of the automobile.",simple,"[{'title': 'Rise of the Smart Car: The Shape-Shifting Motoring Future is Already Here', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/rise-of-the-smart-car-the-shape-shifting-motoring-future-is-already-here/'}]",True,"Manufacturers, suppliers, and technology companies are focusing on several areas for reinvention:

What are some factors that can spur the adoption of BEVs in fleet businesses?,"['asm? Fleet decision-makers want evidence that BEVs can deliver.\n\n\nPilot test programs prove to be the most popular model in spurring adoption. Fifty-two percent of fleet leaders stated that partnering with a company to try out BEVs at a low, fixed cost would make them more likely to contemplate the switch. In addition, decision-makers demonstrate enthusiasm for models that offer turnkey solutions and fleet-as-a-service. Both could help to address the steep infrastructure and learning curves posed by the integration and management of BEVs.\n\n\nOngoing education also has a role to play. In its \n“Run on Less – Electric” program\n, the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE) works with fleets already using BEVs to collect data on the benefits and difficulties of fleet electrification. Projects like these can enable smaller businesses that don’t have the resources to take on new risks to better understand the realities of managing BEVs.\n\n\nA Push for Change in the Regulatory Landscape\n\n\nIn the past few years, much has changed to encourage the adoption of BEVs. Through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the federal government is offering a clean vehicle tax credit of up to $40,000 for electric commercial vehicles. A billion-dollar pool of grants and rebates is also available through states, local governments and municipalities.\n\n\nIn addition, proposed regulations from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—along with state-level initiatives such as two California Air Resource Board (CARB) sister rulings—are designed to increase the proportion of zero and near-zero emission vehicles on the road in the next 10 to 15 years. CARB’s Advanced Clean Truck (ACT) rule is aimed at commercial vehicle manufacturers and the vehicles they produce, while the Advanced Clean Fleet (ACF) ruling is targeted at businesses that buy and operate vehicles.\n\n\nAll that said, a wide variety of businesses operate within the fleet market and, thus far, both regulations and manufacturers have focused much of the electrification push on larger companies. Although this has been to the near-term detriment of small and medium businesses, it does provide an opportunity for vehicle manufacturers and service providers to take learnings from the enterprise level and scale them down to make BEV adoption more manageable for the smaller fleets.\n\n\nA Dynamic Road Ahead on the BEV Adoption Curve\n\n\nGiven the nuances making most businesses unique, automakers must work to align the promise of the electrified fleet with the expectations and needs of each customer. BEVs are more than just the vehicles fleets have always known—BEVs represent a paradigm shift to a further sprawling ecosystem of services and functions. Manufacturers and service providers must shift with them, where every element of the BEV ownership experience will need to be rock solid to attract and retain fleet customers, and many decision-makers are waiting for more evidence that BEVs can live up to their promise.\n\n\nContrary to many headlines, the commercial vehicle and fleet industry remains in the early stages of the BEV adoption curve and the path to fleet electrification will be dynamic, complex and sometimes unpredictable. This is a challenge for both vehicle manufacturers and service providers, as well as companies operating vehicles. This is a journey on a winding road that will take time, testing, flexibility and patience to overcome.\n\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about our study findings or how we can help you better understand the journey and perspectives of commercial vehicle and fleet businesses in their transition to BEVs, please click the button below to send us a note.']","Pilot test programs, partnering with a company to try out BEVs at a low cost, turnkey solutions and fleet-as-a-service models, ongoing education and data collection programs, clean vehicle tax credits and grants, proposed regulations from the US EPA and CARB, and scaling down electrification efforts for smaller fleets.",simple,"[{'title': 'Fleet Decision-Makers See BEVs as the Future of Fleet but Need Proof That the Ecosystem Can Deliver', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/fleet-decision-makers-see-bevs-as-the-future-of-fleet-but-need-proof-that-the-ecosystem-can-deliver/'}]",True,"Several factors can spur the adoption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in fleet businesses.

How can projective exercises contribute to achieving greater depth and validity of insight in qualitative research?,"[' the brain, which is what properly constructed projective exercises do.\n\n\nWhat did we learn?\n\n\nIn summary, our learnings suggest that an effective projective exercise:\n\n\n\n\nIs phrased indirectly, offering the ego protection of an object or image that participants can project their feelings and thoughts onto.\n\n\nTriggers an immediate response, accessing the fast-thinking, subconscious part of the brain.\n\n\nMakes emotions more accessible to participants, facilitating exploration of the whys behind the immediate response.\n\n\nIs not about the creative device used. Superpowers, princesses, aliens or nature pictures can all be effective stimuli if the questions asked about them are crafted carefully, but can also be ineffective if worded improperly.\n\n\n\n\nSo, how can we apply this knowledge to rescue our superpower question? It’s a subtle change that’s as simple as making this direct question indirect. For example, “If you could create a qualitative superhero, which superpower(s) would he or she have?”\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed this three-minute lesson and that it has helped to strengthen your personal qualitative superpowers!', 'Projective exercises—the presentation of calibrated stimuli onto which a respondent projects their feelings, attitudes or beliefs—are a critical asset in the qualitative researcher’s emotional toolbox. The technique offers the promise of achieving greater depth and validity of insight by facilitating expression of subconscious or difficult-to-articulate feelings that are less accessible using direct “Q&A.”\n\n\nBut what makes for a good projective exercise?\n\n\nWe put learning into action at a recent market research conference by testing a series of probes that revealed some lessons about projectives.\n\n\nFirst, we asked visitors to our booth to help us learn about, “What makes great qualitative research.” We then invited them to post onto a chalkboard their reactions to a probe related to the goal of understanding how to deliver great\xa0\nqualitative research\n. Our lesson on projectives focuses on contrasting two of several probes that we asked:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is your qualitative superpower?\n\n\nWhat Disney princess would make a great moderator?\n\n\n\n\nBefore reading on, what do you notice about these questions? Is one easier for you to answer? Do you suspect one would elicit superior insights vs. the other? Let’s explore what we observed and discuss why one question might better achieve the promise of projective techniques.\n\n\nWhat is your qualitative superpower?\n\n\nThis question elicited some interesting responses including humor, empathy, x-ray vision, color coding stuff, cat herding, shoe wearing, connections, fortune-telling and brainstorming solutions.\n\n\nParticipants took time with this question, contemplated it with seriousness and their answers were well thought out before they were posted. While you might be tempted to say, “Yes! This is a good, thought-provoking projective exercise!” think again. This question was difficult, and maybe even a little intimidating, for our fellow market researchers to answer. Starting with body language, respondents tended to step back or to the side when hearing the question. Further, most were unable to answer spontaneously and didn’t necessarily choose a response that was instinctual.\xa0 Rather, they were apt to carefully articulate a response that others would judge as “correct.” Finally, some shook their heads and walked away without answering.\n\n\nBut why? The answer is that this is a very personal way of probing into “what makes great qualitative research.” The question looks like a projective (given the superpower content), but it’s not because it lacks an object for respondents to project their emotions and thoughts onto. Participants were being asked to directly and publicly reveal a personal quality (a power) that is also open to judgment (the power was supposed to be “super” after all). As a result, the probe created tension and triggered guarded, rational brain/slow thinking and filtered responding that was influenced by self-presentation bias.\n\n\nThis scenario points out an often-overlooked quality of effective projective exercises: True projective exercises are ego-protective. That is, the respondent should be able to answer without worrying about what others will say or that there is a right or wrong answer. Offering an ambiguous object onto which personal traits or feelings are projected creates a safe environment that helps participants access their subconscious and raise it to the surface, priming them for deeper, more emotionally centered insight. By way of analogy, projective exercises are similar to the safe space that is created when a person asks for advice for an issue that their “friend” is having, when in reality, the issue is theirs but they are uncomfortable admitting they’re having a problem.\n\n\nWhat Disney princess would make a great moderator?\n\n\nAnswers included a wide range of princesses, including: Mulan (bold), Esmerelda (tolerant), Belle (inquisitive), Jasmine (intuitive), Merida (determined, curious) and Cinderella (caring). We also had one respondent who didn’t relate well to princesses but offered Dory from Finding Nemo (keeps asking and asking and asking questions).\n\n\nThe princess question was far easier for participants to answer and was candidly much more fun! Respondents didn’t need to think or process to come up with the name of a princess—they knew one immediately. In terms of body language, participants tended to lean in, smile and emote enthusiasm. This was a sharp contrast to the body language and manner of responding elicited by the superpower question.\n\n\nUpon probing as to why a particular princess (or fish) was chosen, rational processing took over and some participants needed a bit of time to search for the rationale for their choices. And that’s fine. The projective device did its job of acting as a prime that helped participants discover and articulate the reasons behind their nomination.\n\n\nOverall, this question is a truer projective exercise that triggered the fast thinking/emotional part of']","Projective exercises can contribute to achieving greater depth and validity of insight in qualitative research by facilitating the expression of subconscious or difficult-to-articulate feelings and thoughts.

However, bundling doesn’t replace the need for automakers to be able to clearly explain to consumers how features function and add value to the driving experience.\n\n\nAs we have learned and other research has clearly shown, consumers can be more satisfied by having less choice. Manufacturers will be more successful if they offer product choices with clearly differentiated and easily explainable features for consumers to quickly understand which options provide them with the benefits they are seeking.

2. Cultural Considerations: In some countries, research starts and ends on time while in others, start and end times are not strictly adhered to. Therefore, managing expectations is key.

3. Technological Factors: Advances in technology have made online research possible in a lot more countries. However, the same rules don't always apply internationally. It can be expensive to follow online bulletin boards outside the US due to translation costs. Also, telephone interviews might not be feasible due to time zone differences and costs of simultaneous translation.

4. Research Methodologies: Flexibility in methodologies is crucial. In the US, online bulletin boards might work. However, in countries like India, you might have to resort to traditional methods like paper diaries.

5. Interview Timings: The length of the interview often gets overlooked. What might be a 60-minute interview in the US is likely to last longer in other countries—just by nature of the other languages. For instance, an English introduction translates longer in German. Building rapport in some countries is a slower process which adds to the length of the interview.

6. Scheduling Norms: When research sessions take place can also greatly vary. For example, in Japan, sessions must be conducted in the evening or over the weekend because working respondents are not willing to miss work to participate in market research.

7. Research Facilities: Research often takes place in atypical locations such as hotel meeting rooms or office buildings, rather than in traditional facilities with one-way mirrors. This can affect the logistics and cost of your research. 

All these factors highlight the importance of careful planning and the need for flexibility when conducting international qualitative research.",1.0,0.9174068022978616,0.99999999998,0.8,1.0,0.9545454541115702,0.9721485677228348,0.457322856216423
How do qualitative methodologies vary internationally and what factors should be considered when conducting research in different countries?,"['As a researcher who devoted 10 years to conducting multi-country international qualitative research, too many times I hear clients talking about international qualitative research like it’s just an extension of their US research. In some cases, qualitative research conducted outside of the US (OUS) may be a lot like US research, but assuming that what works in the US is going to work well in other countries can result in a lot of unpleasant surprises.\n\n\nFor example, the first time I did research in India, I hadn’t arranged for a simultaneous translator because I assumed the respondents spoke English. They definitely did, but as the conversation during the focus group grew animated, they started lapsing into “Hinglish,” switching between English and Hindi—sometimes even in the same sentence. I was totally lost. I learned that lesson quickly and had a simultaneous translator with me by the next day. But there are a lot of other things that I learned along the way, and I hope this blog post will spare you from making some of the same mistakes!\n\n\nThe meaning of “on-time” interviews\n\n\nTake something as simple as the start and end times for a focus group. In the US, if the group is supposed to start at 6 pm, it generally starts somewhere around 6 pm—maybe a few minutes late but no big deal—and if it runs a little longer than the two hours planned, also usually no big deal.\n\n\nSo, when your client arrives for a 6 pm focus group in a Latin American (LATAM) country, they may be expecting it to start at 6pm – and then they start getting agitated when it’s 7 pm and still no signs of starting. I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve seen a focus group in Mexico or Brazil start even close to “on time.” And if the topics aren’t all covered and the group is still talking two hours later, that’s usually fine, too… especially since your 8 pm group isn’t going to start on time either. But in other markets like Germany and Japan, research starts and ends on time—to start late or keep a respondent over is unacceptably rude so you’d better be ready to start and finish right on time. Managing expectations ahead of time can help any agitation a client might feel about an interview that is starting “late” or is ended abruptly at the “end time.”\n\n\nYour methodology might vary\n\n\nThere have been a lot of advances in qualitative methodologies, and we’re able to conduct online research in a much wider range of countries than ever before, but the same rules don’t always apply internationally. Researchers and clients in the US love online bulletin boards for their ability to get a wide range of responses that can be probed in real time. But, unless your client is fluent in multiple languages, online bulletin boards outside of the US can’t be followed in real time—it is almost cost-prohibitive to follow them at all when you think about the translation costs for the huge amounts of data that an online bulletin board can generate. And in some cultures like Japan, it isn’t considered culturally appropriate to conduct research via online bulletin boards, as older generations prefer face to face and privacy concerns about sharing on the internet are prevalent.\n\n\nOf course, there are workarounds like machine translation or having the analysis done in-country by a native speaker, but it’s something that has to be considered during the planning phase. The same can apply for telephone interviews—while US clients are used to being able to dial in and listen, simultaneous translation over a telephone can pose problems—not to mention the time difference: is someone really available at 4 am on a Saturday to listen live to physician research taking place in Japan (which often takes place over the weekend)?\n\n\nIn almost every market in the world, there’s a way to get the job done—it just might not be the same way as in the US—so being flexible with methodologies is important. I was once doing online bulletin boards in the US with women and teens on their face care routines—and in India, it turned out we had to do paper diaries. The research team in India had to hand-deliver each diary and then come back to the respondents’ homes to pick up the diaries a week later. It had been a while since I had even thought of paper diaries, but the results were just as rich and insightful!\n\n\nIs your 60-minute interview really 60 minutes?\n\n\nThe length of the interview is another consideration that often gets overlooked. What might be a 60-minute interview in the US is likely to last longer in other countries—just by nature of the other languages. Consider a standard introduction in English and how much longer those same words are when translated into German.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n']","Qualitative methodologies can vary internationally due to cultural differences and language barriers. Factors that should be considered when conducting research in different countries include the start and end times for focus groups, as different cultures may have different expectations regarding punctuality. Additionally, the use of online bulletin boards may not be feasible in all countries due to language barriers and cultural preferences for face-to-face interactions. Translation costs and time differences should also be taken into account when conducting telephone interviews. Overall, flexibility with methodologies and understanding cultural norms are important when conducting international qualitative research.",simple,"[{'title': 'Lessons Learned Traveling the World to Conduct Qualitative Research', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/lessons-learned-traveling-the-world-to-conduct-qualitative-research/'}]",True,"Qualitative methodologies can greatly vary internationally due to factors such as language, cultural norms, technological advancements, and even the perception of time. Here are the factors that need consideration while conducting research in different countries:

How will the demand for video-conferencing systems be affected by the shift to remote work?,"['Over seven years ago I started work at Escalent as a remote employee. No one else on my team worked remotely and there were no systems in place for my work arrangement. To make meaningful connections with colleagues, I would chat for a few minutes before or after we got down to work. I could hear them rolling their eyes and wondering how fast they could get off the phone and done with work to rush home.\n\n\nHow things have changed! Now that we all work remotely, we chat regularly over the phone, through our Teams system, FaceTime, Zoom or WebEx. We flex our work day and find ways to connect meaningfully. Many of us have leaned into this new world in big and little ways. For example, I moved out of my suburban townhouse and into a more rural home with a bit of land and a beautiful view. I have friends who moved closer to their preferred recreation spot (from the Seattle area to Colorado for snowboarding, and to the bay shore in Texas to sail). While this may seem anecdotal, a \nstudy by Redfin\n showed 50% of employees in New York, Seattle, San Francisco and Boston would move if working from home became permanent. Many are buying bigger homes a bit further out of the city to have dueling home offices or a space for the kids to do school at home. And, companies are responding with \nhome office stipends\n to entice and retain talent.\n\n\nWhat does that mean for the old business models? Innovation is required.\n\n\nThere is no going back. That old world where the sales team was flying hither and yon and taking clients to dinner to cement relationships or celebrate partnerships is over. The long-term impact of this change alone cascades out over many industries.\n\n\nAirlines, hotels and restaurants will need to recalibrate expectations and revenue models for a long-term \nreduction in business travel\n. Additionally, service tiers, loyalty plans, marketing messages and the marketing mix will all need to be reimagined. There may be new areas of growth simmering, but one thing is sure, these businesses will need to quickly understand where they need to fill gaps and find new opportunities to make up for lost revenue.\n\n\nOn the flip side, demand for high-end video-conferencing systems will rise, along with increased need for fast and seamless gigabit internet service flowing through newly upgraded home routers and modems for uninterrupted conferencing. And, as employees continue to migrate away from big cities, there will be fresh demand for better service in some of the harder-to-reach corners of the country. How to meet demand and evaluate where enhancements are needed to maintain healthy growth will be essential.\n\n\nSome areas of growth may be surprising\n\n\nDigital enhancements at home are being countered by very analog realities: building a physical home office with all the trappings. My friends who have moved to homes that accommodate work-from-home and home school setups are not alone. The many following this trend are kitting out their new homes with adjustable standing desks, ergonomic chairs, dual-monitor stations and printers. As I type out *printers* I can hear the collective groan of millions of Millennials and Xennials who had \nfamously eschewed\n\xa0these analog devices but \nnow find they require\n them. The new work-from-home realities give printer companies new opportunities to lock in far more of these generational markets. Frankly, \ntechnology\n companies that have grown comfortable selling to businesses with IT staff face interesting opportunities will need to shift messaging, packaging and installation instructions to serve end users.\n\n\nWorking from home represents a significant shift in how our world works across many elements. For example, it will impact public transportation and how we use automobiles—will people still need two cars per home? And, how does it change the calculation when considering electric cars?\n\n\nThese changes aren’t temporary and the ripple effects have far-reaching impact. Over this past year, we witnessed a lot of adaptation with little understanding of what the long-term impact would be. Now, we are starting to see what the long-term changes are and how they might shape the future of how business is conducted across all levels.\n\n\nLooking for a partner who can help make murky waters clear in your innovation journey?

The Chinese Are Coming, and What It Means for BEV Adoption\n\n\nMany traditional automotive brands were conspicuous by their absence at IAA Mobility, including Ford, Audi and the Stellantis brands (except for a token effort by Opel). Of the automakers that were present, Chinese brands occupied at least twice the floor space as the other brands combined.\n\n\nThe Chinese presence was led by BYD, which introduced its Seal compact luxury BEV, a direct competitor to the Tesla Model 3. Other Chinese brands represented included Seres Group, Dongfeng, Leapmotor, XEV and MG Motor (a British brand owned by Chinese conglomerate SAIC). Geely-owned brands Zeekr and Polestar also had cameos at supplier booths. Across these brands, every vehicle shown was a BEV and pricing was highly competitive, not just with American and European BEVs but also with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.\n\n\nDuring my presentation at IAA Mobility, I shared data from the latest EVForward Europe study that show how BEV sales in the EU and UK are stalling due, in part, to the transition between “early adopter” customers who were willing to pay more for a BEV and “early mainstream” consumers who aren’t.\n\n\n\n\nEscalent’s EV expert K.C.

However, findings suggested that the most progressive customer groups on the EV adoption curve are not unconditional advocates, signifying a need for varied support to make the prospect of EV adoption look more reassuring and rewarding.","['k.c', '.', 'boyce', 'shared', 'insights', 'on', 'the', 'characteristics', ',', 'motivations', ',', 'and', 'emotions', 'of', 'the', 'ev', 'buyer', 'personas', 'identified', 'by', 'the', 'evforward', 'europe', 'study', '.']","['the', 'evforward', 'europe', 'study', 'identified', 'six', 'unique', 'european', 'ev', 'buyer', 'personas', 'and', 'their', 'likelihood', 'to', 'adopt', 'evs', '.', 'two', 'lead', 'personas', 'that', 'have', 'driven', 'ev', 'adoption', 'so', 'far', ',', 'the', 'pillar', 'and', 'the', 'pioneer', ',', 'entered', 'the', 'ev', 'market', 'due', 'to', 'strong', 'convictions', '.', 'the', 'pillar', 'persona', 'recognized', 'the', 'environmental', 'benefits', 'of', 'evs', 'to', 'society', ',', 'while', 'the', 'pioneer', 'was', 'excited', 'by', 'the', 'latest', 'technology', '.', 'in', '2023', ',', 'fewer', 'new-car', 'buyers', 'regard', 'evs', 'as', '“', 'the', 'future', '”', ',', 'creating', 'a', 'shift', 'towards', '``', 'interesting', 'idea', ""''"", '.', 'despite', 'the', 'ongoing', 'majority', 'of', 'the', 'pillar', 'and', 'pioneer', 'persona', 'groups', 'viewing', 'evs', 'as', '“', 'the', 'future', '”', ',', 'only', '21', '%', 'of', 'the', 'third', 'persona', ',', 'the', 'influencer', ',', 'are', 'equally', 'confident—a', 'decrease', 'from', 'the', 'previous', 'year', '.', 'findings', 'showed', '25', '%', 'of', 'those', 'who', 'found', 'ev', 'ownership', 'experience', 'better', 'than', 'expected', 'state', 'they', 'would', 'not', 'buy', 'an', 'ev', 'next', 'time', ',', 'demonstrating', 'some', 'doubts', 'about', 'the', 'viability', 'of', 'evs', '.', 'in', 'terms', 'of', 'charging', ',', 'most', 'new-car', 'buyers', 'prefer', 'home', 'charging', 'as', 'their', 'main', 'option', 'but', 'also', 'need', 'some', 'form', 'of', 'plan', 'b', 'or', 'contingency', ',', 'generally', 'via', 'public', 'charging', '.', 'the', 'study', 'found', 'reassurance', 'about', 'being', 'able', 'to', 'rely', 'on', 'public', 'charging', 'comes', ',', 'in', 'part', ',', 'from', 'visible', 'charging', 'options', '.', 'the', 'study', 'also', 'found', 'that', 'automakers', 'can', 'play', 'the', 'role', 'of', 'a', 'trusted', 'advisor', 'throughout', 'the', 'ev', 'ownership', 'experience', '.', 'this', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'by', 'combining', 'trusted', 'techniques', 'with', 'new', 'communications', 'technology', 'and', 'over-the-air', 'vehicle', 'software', 'updates', '.', 'this', 'will', 'lead', 'to', 'more', 'enriched', 'and', 'more', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'with', 'their', 'customers', 'throughout', 'the', 'ev', 'ownership', 'tenure', '.', 'the', 'study', 'concluded', 'that', 'manufacturers', 'must', 'work', 'to', 'improve', 'the', 'ev', 'proposition', 'so', 'that', 'potential', 'buyers', 'can', 'recognise', 'other', 'characteristics', 'that', 'can', 'influence', 'purchase', 'beyond', 'environmental', 'benefits', '.', 'lastly', ',', 'the', 'study', 'identified', 'that', 'the', 'transition', 'to', 'the', 'more', 'volume-significant', 'early', 'majority', 'from', 'the', 'early', 'adopter', 'typology', 'is', 'crucial', 'for', 'a', 'return', 'on', 'investment', '(', 'roi', ')', 'for', 'automotive', 'original', 'equipment', 'manufacturers', '(', 'oems', ')', '.', 'however', ',', 'findings', 'suggested', 'that', 'the', 'most', 'progressive', 'customer', 'groups', 'on', 'the', 'ev', 'adoption', 'curve', 'are', 'not', 'unconditional', 'advocates', ',', 'signifying', 'a', 'need', 'for', 'varied', 'support', 'to', 'make', 'the', 'prospect', 'of', 'ev', 'adoption', 'look', 'more', 'reassuring', 'and', 'rewarding', '.']",0.0127080657928272,0.0807174871563876,0.803325,0.8833254,0.8414279,"There are several new techniques being employed to improve the accuracy of polling predictions.

Quite simply, the potential to close the gap is smaller as many Americans have already voted, and most others have decided for whom they will vote.\n\n\nPollsters have gotten smarter:\n\n\nBeyond these encouraging signs for pollsters, many of the most well-known and respected polls have made changes to their methodologies to correct for areas that were previously lacking. Commonly, polls are now incorporating corrections for education and better coverage of cell phone-only households—two factors that contributed to misses in key 2016 swing states.\n\n\nAdditionally, innovative techniques for prediction and cross-validation are being put in place in some polls. The USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research, for instance, is not only asking about personal voting intentions this year, but also asking people how they think members of their social circle will vote, and how they think others in their state will vote, as a way to indirectly predict election results in a way that is less subject to false reporting. Time will tell if these techniques will provide consistent and accurate estimates, but new techniques like these illustrate an evolution in polling science.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\nPolitical polling and market opinion research have grown from the same roots, evolving from learnings made in each field. Today, they continue to address some common challenges facing each industry, including issues of non-response and sampling error. Furthering the challenge, political polling must also contend with voting dynamics that do not impact other types of opinion research. Regardless of how things turn out in the 2020 election, both industries will continue to enhance their techniques and borrow successful strategies from one another to account for the ever-changing world at large.\n\n\nWhile it is not a sure bet that the polls will be correct this year, one thing is for certain: Americans will be glued to their television sets and smartphones on Tuesday, and likely for several days, if not weeks after.\n\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about the differences between political polling and market research, \nsend us a note\n.']","The USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research is using innovative techniques such as asking people about their personal voting intentions, as well as how they think members of their social circle and others in their state will vote.

How can dealerships position themselves as a reliable source of information on EV ownership and maintenance?,"['Despite the growth of low-touch, online and remote services spearheaded by electric vehicle (EV) specialist automakers such as Tesla and Rivian, consumers still favor dealerships.\n\n\nIn our new \nEVForward\nTM\n Dealer DeepDive report, Escalent surveyed new-vehicle buyers to understand the role they want dealers to play during the shopping process and throughout the lifetime of EV ownership.\n\n\nTo keep pace with the next generation of electric vehicle buyers, dealers should lean into existing consumer trust—and position themselves as a reliable source of information on EV ownership and maintenance. But to remain competitive with alternative sales and service models, gaps in the consumer experience need to be addressed.\n\n\nAn Important Touch Point for Selling EVs\n\n\nWhen it comes to purchasing and maintaining an EV, consumers consider the dealership a key touch point.\n\n\nWhile almost one-quarter of respondents said they would consider purchasing an EV directly from the manufacturer, nearly all new-vehicle buyers rely on dealers during their shopping process: 94% of respondents reported contacting a dealership the last time they shopped for a vehicle.\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, consumers indicated that dealers are top of mind for questions regarding warranties, rebates and incentives. With the changes to the federal EV tax credit contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, it is all the more important for dealers to provide guidance around rebates and incentives.\n\n\nHowever, only 48% of EV owners said they received a rebate or incentive when they purchased their vehicle. Many expressed that they did not feel their dealer supported them in identifying available rebates and incentives. On a five-point scale, 65% rated the helpfulness of their dealer at a three or below. This gap between customer expectations and experience is critical for OEMs and dealerships to address.\n\n\nWhile 88% of buyers said they were satisfied with their dealership experience, consumers gave lower marks to staff knowledge of EV charging. Although EV owners generally have a greater degree of comfort with new technology, future buyers aren’t quite as comfortable. As a trusted source of information, dealers can improve the customer experience—and potentially boost sales significantly—by providing more robust support around the “fueling” experience for customers.\n\n\nConsumers demonstrated an appetite for in-person experiences during both vehicle shopping and ownership. 69% of respondents said they rely on dealers to provide repairs and service. Meanwhile, 66% thought test drives should happen through the dealer, and more than half said purchasing or leasing the vehicle—including pricing, negotiation and discounts—should take place at the dealership.\n\n\nCentering Consumer Preference\n\n\nEV specialist automakers have instigated a shift toward leaner, online-oriented retail approaches, including remote services and branded stores with minimal inventory. Traditional OEMs are starting to follow the trend—but consumers have mixed feelings.\n\n\nFewer than half of all survey respondents would be comfortable if their vehicle shopping, purchasing or leasing, and maintenance phases were shifted entirely online or to the customer’s home. On the other hand, the post-COVID-19 consumer is more comfortable—and in some cases, expects—the convenience of virtual engagement and mobile services. EV specialist approaches that enhance consumer control and convenience, such as mobile service and scheduling appointments online, scored higher marks.\n\n\nThe takeaway? OEMs and dealers should make decisions based on consumer preference rather than just mirroring the tactics employed by EV specialists. An omnichannel approach, where buyers can seamlessly and effortlessly complete any phase of their transaction via their preferred channel, can help to balance convenience with the peace of mind that an in-person visit can offer.\n\n\nInventory Limitations: Acceptable, But Not Ideal\n\n\nAs inventory limitations due to supply chain constraints continue to plague dealers, buyers are extending understanding—up to a point. Consumers are willing to order their vehicle and wait, but most consider seven weeks to be too long. 70% of survey respondents said they would be willing to wait less than a month before they pivot to purchase or lease a different vehicle. 46% would be willing to wait a few weeks, and 24% would wait only a few days.\n\n\n\n\nWhile consumers would prefer dealerships to have enough inventory to see and experience their vehicle in person, most do not blame the dealer or the manufacturer for the current shortages. 91% of respondents said a long wait time would have somewhat, or no, negative impact on their perception of the dealership, while 94% said the same for the vehicle brand.\n\n\nBuilding Trust; Instilling Confidence in EV Shoppers\n\n\nFor consumers, the dealer is still the preferred source of information when buying a new vehicle. But buyer pain points, such as dissatisfaction with the level of staff expertise on EV-specific issues, represent vulnerabilities in the current model.\n\n\nTo increase buyer confidence, dealerships must continue to deliver superior in-person service—and be ready to educate consumers on the ins and outs of EV ownership.

How can automakers and utility companies increase BEV adoption?,"['To create the conditions for more battery electric vehicle (BEV) “wins” in shopping journeys, automakers need to increase consumer exposure to the realities of BEV ownership—long before consumers reach the point of purchase.\n\n\nIn a recent study, 85% of BEV owners state that they became aware of the vehicle they chose at least a few months before purchasing one, affording them ample time to explore the reality of owning a BEV and overcome common concerns, such as where and how the BEV can be charged.\n\n\nIn contrast, 46% of non-BEV shoppers report first becoming aware of the vehicle they chose immediately before purchase or in the days or weeks prior—making them more often “spur of the moment” purchasers.\n\n\nThese are just some of the findings from our new \nEVForward\nTM\n Path to Purchase DeepDive report, which examines the differences in shopping journeys among BEV owners, BEV shoppers (those who shopped for but ultimately didn’t buy a BEV) and non-BEV shoppers (those who neither shopped for nor owned a BEV) to identify how to increase BEV consideration throughout the consumer journey and, ultimately, spur greater BEV purchases.\n\n\nAutomakers and utility companies have a much greater opportunity to more effectively drive BEV adoption by boosting BEV consideration and winning over future buyers \nbefore\n they are even triggered to shop for a new car.\n\n\nPaving the Way Ahead of Purchase\n\n\nBecause non-BEV shoppers don’t typically plan their vehicle purchases well in advance, automakers have limited opportunity to increase BEV adoption if focused on influencing consumers during the shopping and decision-making process. Without the time to address BEV concerns (such as misconceptions around day-to-day ownership costs, rebates/incentives and charging), shoppers without prior BEV exposure tend to default to what they know—internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. As a result, BEV consideration appears restricted to those who have done their research ahead of time, drastically reducing the chances that a BEV will make the short list for a spontaneous shopper.\n\n\nTo tap into new consumer bases, automakers need to reach and influence consumers long before their new-vehicle shopping journey begins. This includes marketing BEVs well in advance of production and reinforcing how BEVs are a reliable, cost-effective and convenient choice.\n\n\nClosing the Gap Between Expectations and Reality\n\n\nOwning a BEV is easier than many expect, but that lesson is slow to permeate the broader market. While 54% of non-BEV shoppers expect owning a BEV to be more complicated than owning an ICE vehicle, half of current BEV owners report that owning a BEV is actually easier than their initial expectations, and only 7% say it is more difficult. This perception that owning a BEV will be more complicated and challenging than an ICE vehicle is a big emotional barrier for consumers that automakers need to resolve—ideally, before the shopping process even begins so consumers will include a BEV in their initial consideration set when they do start shopping for a new vehicle.\n\n\n\n\nThe ease of home charging, the convenience of not having to visit a gas station, and a reduced need for regular maintenance are all compelling points in favor of BEVs around the ease of day-to-day ownership. Automakers should also focus on assuaging fears around vehicle longevity—such as emphasizing that BEV powertrain warranties protect against severe battery degradation for 10 years or 100,000 miles.\n\n\nUtility companies equally have a unique opportunity to connect with consumers before and throughout the BEV shopping journey. Only 16% of BEV owners report speaking to their utility company about their electricity rates ahead of purchase—highlighting a missed opportunity to illustrate the realities of BEV ownership to potential future buyers.\n\n\nTo bring more shoppers into the fold, utility companies should be proactive in helping potential owners understand how to “fuel” their vehicle at home, in public, and on road trips, as well as in demonstrating that the charging infrastructure is already widespread.\n\n\nLeveraging Consumer Loyalty\n\n\nWhile BEV-specific education paints a part of the picture, automakers can also capitalize on existing brand exposure and loyalty. Many car buyers learned about their current vehicle because they previously owned the same make or model. Reusing name plates or offering vehicles with various powertrains—ICE, hybrid and BEV—can create a sense of familiarity and help consumers overcome BEV hesitation.\n\n\nWord of mouth presents a huge opportunity, too—88% of BEV owners report knowing at least a few other BEV owners prior to purchase, which is in stark contrast to the 62% of non-BEV shoppers who said nobody they know owned a BEV. Between not knowing anyone with a BEV and having little-to-no other form of exposure to BEVs, it is easy to understand why non-BEV']","Automakers and utility companies can increase BEV adoption by increasing consumer exposure to the realities of BEV ownership before consumers reach the point of purchase. They can market BEVs well in advance of production, reinforce the benefits of BEVs, address concerns and misconceptions, highlight the ease of day-to-day ownership, emphasize vehicle longevity and powertrain warranties, and provide education and support on charging infrastructure.

By adopting these strategies, automakers and utility companies may be able to increase the rate of BEV adoption.","['automakers', 'and', 'utility', 'companies', 'can', 'increase', 'bev', 'adoption', 'by', 'increasing', 'consumer', 'exposure', 'to', 'the', 'realities', 'of', 'bev', 'ownership', 'before', 'consumers', 'reach', 'the', 'point', 'of', 'purchase', '.', 'they', 'can', 'market', 'bevs', 'well', 'in', 'advance', 'of', 'production', ',', 'reinforce', 'the', 'benefits', 'of', 'bevs', ',', 'address', 'concerns', 'and', 'misconceptions', ',', 'highlight', 'the', 'ease', 'of', 'day-to-day', 'ownership', ',', 'emphasize', 'vehicle', 'longevity', 'and', 'powertrain', 'warranties', ',', 'and', 'provide', 'education', 'and', 'support', 'on', 'charging', 'infrastructure', '.', 'automakers', 'can', 'also', 'leverage', 'existing', 'brand', 'exposure', 'and', 'loyalty', ',', 'and', 'utility', 'companies', 'can', 'proactively', 'educate', 'potential', 'owners', 'about', 'charging', 'options', 'and', 'demonstrate', 'the', 'widespread', 'availability', 'of', 'charging', 'infrastructure', '.']","['the', 'studies', 'suggest', 'several', 'ways', 'for', 'automakers', 'and', 'utility', 'companies', 'to', 'increase', 'bev', 'adoption', ':', '1.', 'improve', 'in-vehicle', 'technology', ':', 'connected', 'vehicle', 'technology', 'is', 'emerging', 'as', 'a', 'key', 'selling', 'point', 'for', 'shoppers', '.', 'so', ',', 'providing', 'the', 'latest', 'in-vehicle', 'technology', 'can', 'motivate', 'potential', 'buyers', 'and', 'overcome', 'barriers', 'to', 'purchasing', 'a', 'bev', '.', '2.', 'alleviate', 'range', 'anxiety', ':', 'connected', 'vehicle', 'technology', 'can', 'also', 'address', 'key', 'concerns', 'among', 'bev', 'shoppers', ',', 'especially', 'around', 'range', '.', 'features', 'such', 'as', 'range', 'alerts', ',', 'range', 'estimators', ',', 'battery', 'diagnostics', ',', 'and', 'charging', 'finders', 'could', 'ease', 'anxiety', 'around', 'vehicle', 'range', ',', 'battery', 'life', ',', 'and', 'access', 'to', 'public', 'charging', '.', '3.', 'expand', 'infrastructure', ':', 'as', 'more', 'charging', 'stations', 'are', 'being', 'built', ',', 'the', 'practicality', 'score', 'of', 'bevs', 'is', 'increasing', '.', 'so', ',', 'expanding', 'the', 'charging', 'infrastructure', 'could', 'certainly', 'encourage', 'more', 'people', 'to', 'consider', 'bevs', '.', '4.', 'education', ':', 'many', 'consumers', 'are', 'not', 'fully', 'aware', 'of', 'bev', 'technology', 'or', 'what', 'owning', 'one', 'entails', '.', 'providing', 'more', 'information', 'on', 'aspects', 'such', 'as', 'how', 'the', 'charging', 'works', ',', 'the', 'benefits', 'of', 'owning', 'a', 'bev', ',', 'and', 'how', 'to', 'maximize', 'their', 'vehicle', 'range', 'could', 'help', 'increase', 'bev', 'adoption', '.', '5.', 'adopting', 'standards', ':', 'the', 'adoption', 'of', 'charging', 'standards', 'like', 'the', 'north', 'american', 'charging', 'standard', '(', 'nacs', ')', 'has', 'been', 'positively', 'received', 'by', 'consumers', 'and', 'can', 'promote', 'confidence', 'in', 'bev', 'technology', '.', '6.', 'build', 'excitement', ':', 'automakers', 'should', 'focus', 'on', 'making', 'bevs', 'exciting', '.', 'this', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'through', 'advertising', 'campaigns', 'that', 'highlight', 'the', 'benefits', 'of', 'bevs', 'or', 'showcase', 'the', 'impressive', 'technology', 'within', 'these', 'vehicles', '.', '7.', 'lower', 'prices', ':', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'major', 'barriers', 'to', 'bev', 'adoption', 'is', 'the', 'high', 'price', 'point', '.', 'therefore', ',', 'offering', 'more', 'affordable', 'models', 'or', 'financial', 'incentives', 'can', 'motivate', 'more', 'consumers', 'to', 'buy', 'bevs', '.', 'by', 'adopting', 'these', 'strategies', ',', 'automakers', 'and', 'utility', 'companies', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'increase', 'the', 'rate', 'of', 'bev', 'adoption', '.']",0.0346497590590401,0.2042553151855138,0.84356296,0.87624395,0.8595929,"According to the DeepDive report, 57% of the respondents prefer the traditional car buying experience, whereas only 20% prefer Tesla’s direct retail model.

Pairing dealer-friendly consumer preferences with an emerging need among carmakers—educating customers regarding electric vehicles (EVs)—offers a look at what a successfully leveraged relationship may look like in the near future.\n\n\nIn fact, 63% of EV Intenders—respondents identified by EVForward as the next generation of EV buyers—in our study have shared that test driving an EV is important in their consideration and decision-making process, while 31% indicate that a dealership salesperson would be among their primary sources of information—a percentage that is likely to go up as more automakers move to fully electrified fleets.

Why is there a lack of measurement and research on the effectiveness of sponsorship spend?,"['The high impact but oft-forgotten area of brand research\n\n\nNearly 20 years ago, I worked with a global CPG corporation that owns some of the world’s most well-known liquor brands. In addition to maintaining one of the largest advertising budgets on the planet at the time, the organization also plowed tens of millions of dollars into high-profile sports sponsorships. Yet unlike the advertising spend, which was subjected to intense scrutiny to measure impact and return on investment, the sponsorships ran year after year with little or no measurement of their value or effectiveness.\n\n\nWhen I, as a curious little whippersnapper, dared to ask why we only measured one side of the marketing mix, I received only terse replies that included “The brand is tied to the event, so why waste money measuring it when we know we have to do it anyway,” “Don’t be silly, there’s no proper way to measure sponsorships,” and “As long as the chairman can still walk 18 holes at St Andrews, we’ll be sponsoring golf tournaments, regardless.” I recall feeling quite disturbed at what I perceived to be not only a marketing blind spot but a gross oversight in corporate governance. Two decades on, I’m still amazed at how often the area of sponsorships is overlooked when organizations measure the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.\n\n\nAn Elephant Hiding in Plain Sight\n\n\nSponsorship spend in North America will exceed $21 billion in 2015, which is equal to one-third of total television advertising, or one-half of all digital advertising. Nearly three-quarters of this is spent on sports, which won’t surprise anyone that has turned on a TV or been to a stadium in recent years. Sponsorship spend is also increasing at a faster rate than anything else in the marketing mix, having grown by 4.2% in 2014, compared to 3.1% for advertising and just 2.8% for public relations/promotions/direct marketing.\n\n\n \xa0 \xa0 \n\n\nSponsorship fees themselves are typically only half of the equation, as they are often more than matched by subsequent spending to advertise and promote them, so it’s fair to say that this area of marketing will approach $50 billion in spend before the year is out. You’d think that such a substantial marketing investment would be supported by a powerhouse of research in order to determine its effectiveness. But you’d be wrong. A \nrecent analysis\n by the Association of National Advertisers uncovered some alarming statistics:\n\n\n\n\nOnly 35% of marketers consistently measure the impact and effectiveness of their sponsorship activities.\n\n\nA full 25% of marketers do not gather, analyze or use any data at all in their sponsorship decision-making, choosing to work on gut instinct alone.\n\n\nOf those that do conduct some form of measurement, only 47% have implemented a standardized process for sponsorship measurement.\n\n\nWhen carrying out sponsorship measurement, only half of marketers make any attempt to isolate the impact of sponsorships from their other marketing initiatives.\n\n\nYet nearly 80% report that the need to validate sponsorship results has increased significantly in the past two years.\n\n\n\n\nIf those numbers aren’t bad enough, in many cases where sponsorship research is actually conducted, the analysis is carried out by either the ad agency or the sponsorship management company. And once the foxes are looking after the henhouse, it’s not surprising that in many cases this research is biased, weak on meaningful measures and consequently not particularly valuable to decision-makers.\n\n\nNon-Measurement for All the Wrong Reasons\n\n\nThe reasons for this apparent blind spot are numerous. Very often, organizations invest so much budget and energy into a sponsorship that they simply don’t leave anything more to measure the impact. In other cases, nobody bothers to measure sponsorship effectiveness because the sponsorship “just feels right.” After all, who is going to argue that having the corporate logo plastered across a major sporting arena is anything but a marketing coup?\n\n\nOther times, the sponsorship is a pet project of an executive, or the organization has been doing it for many years, so conducting an assessment of the sponsorship value potentially carries some political risk.\n\n\n\n\nTop Tip: Measure Outcomes, Not Outputs\n\n\nMany marketers make the mistake of collecting data that are easy to measure, rather than what actually matters. As a result, they end up measuring ‘outputs’ such as what a sponsor got or did, rather than ‘outcomes’—what a sponsorship actually produced with the target audience. The most common outputs measured are media exposure and digital impressions. But these proxy measures aren’t able to capture whether a sponsorship actually impacted perceptions, attitudes and behaviors, leading to purchase and other desired actions. \n\n\n\n\nPerhaps most alarmingly, the most oft-cited reason for not measuring the effectiveness of sponsorships is that']","The reasons for the lack of measurement and research on the effectiveness of sponsorship spend are numerous.

Why is truth in advertising important for both consumers and brands?,"['There was a time when brands had near-complete control over what was said about their offerings, as they were the ones doing most of the talking. Even the casual observer knows this is no longer the case. The proliferation of technology, data and digital communication has put an ever-increasing amount of control in the hands of consumers. Nowadays, an assertion made by a brand regarding the benefits of an offering, i.e., an advertising claim, can readily be verified through objective measurement or subjective experience, and the results easily shared with a global audience.\n\n\nThis democratization of information has been great for individuals (ask anyone who has recently purchased a motor vehicle), but has it benefited brands as well? The answer is a hearty but qualified yes. In order to reap the benefits of this paradigm shift, it is incumbent on brands to \nbe honest.\n It is well-established that deception is toxic to any relationship, including that of brands and consumers. Honest \nbrand management\n and communication helps build trust and works toward the holy grail of brands, authenticity. Conversely, a deception is likely to be uncovered, leading to backlash that often negates any short-term gains. The \nnews has been rife with high-profile examples\n of this in recent years, leaving many offenders with an expensive and years-long effort to rebuild trust in the brand.\n\n\nIf the truth is both powerful and necessary when building trusted and authentic brands, why are false or misleading advertising claims still out there?\n The answer: the truth isn’t always easy. Let’s look at some of the forces at work that cause even highly reputable brands to occasionally make claims that are ultimately judged to be false or misleading.\n\n\nAdvertising speech in the US is regulated. The FTC lays it out plainly: \n“federal law says that [ads] must be truthful, not misleading, and, when appropriate, backed by scientific evidence.”\n Most advertisers spend a fair amount of time and money to collect this type of information to support their claims. When the science is done in good faith but a claim still falls short of the truth standard, it is usually because there is a disconnect between the science and the manner in which the advertiser expresses the claim. For example, if a given product is shown to be preferred over a competitive product but the people asked to compare the products were not representative of the population as a whole, the advertiser is being less than truthful if they make an unqualified preference claim.\n\n\nThere are several reasons that false or misleading claims are made. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\nNavigating the regulatory landscape requires that advertisers have access to the appropriate legal and research experts, and many advertisers, particularly smaller ones, simply don’t have the required access.\n\n\nThe body of evidence intended to support a claim might be incomplete coupled with time pressures that do not allow for sufficiently robust science.\n\n\nSome advertisers place short-term gain ahead of more noble pursuits like satisfying consumers and telling the truth and hope that consumers won’t know, care or remember.\n\n\n\n\nGiven the ever-increasing scrutiny by regulators and competitors and the infinite memory of the internet, it is natural to wonder why an advertiser would take on the risk associated with making an advertising claim that is not fully supported. Many industry categories are saturated with highly optimized offerings, creating an economy of virtually unlimited choice. This creates two opposing forces—the differences between offerings is shrinking while the need to stand out is growing. Further hampering an offering’s ability to stand out in a world of unlimited options is that consumers will always have limited bandwidth. Getting a consumer to tolerate a brand’s interruption and devote some attention to it often feels like an impossible task, requiring companies to create advertisements that hit the tiny sweet spot of personal relevance, contextual relevance, and enjoyment.\n\n\nThe good news for brands is that despite the challenges created by the complex consumer, marketplace and regulatory landscapes, brands that communicate the truths of functionality and experience tend to build healthier, more profitable and more enduring brands (\ncheck out Unerman and Baskin’s “Tell the Truth” for more on this\n). Truth in advertising is the only brand communication strategy that meets the ultimate desires of both consumers and brands, allowing consumers to make informed choices and brands to build and nurture authentic and valuable consumer relationships.']","Truth in advertising is important for both consumers and brands because it allows consumers to make informed choices and helps brands build and nurture authentic and valuable consumer relationships.

How would UK and US car buyers react to overnight price hikes for car brands due to trade tariffs and how would it impact their purchasing behavior?,"['In both the UK and US, there is currently a real risk for political dynamics to result in the imposition of trade tariffs that have selective, disruptive effects on various product categories.\n\n\nTraditionally, vehicle manufacturers have been able to introduce modest price rises almost indiscernibly. Sometimes, currency fluctuations may also serve to inflate prices but, critically, neither mechanism tends to disrupt the pricing hierarchy.\n\n\nIf sizeable tariffs are applied to vehicle brands from specific countries or regions, there is potential for the pricing hierarchy of brands to be massively disrupted.\n\n\nSo, how might car buyers react to massive overnight price hikes for various car brands? We conducted a small scale, attitudinal study in the UK and US to determine what car buyers would actually do in various scenarios.\n\n\nIt is clear in both countries that, faced with a discernibly higher price, car buyer behaviour would scatter in all sorts of different directions. In the UK, only 17% of car buyers would stick with their original make/model preference. A further one third would likely stay with their preferred brand but also seek a means of mitigating the price increase by down-grading on trim levels or segment. With one quarter delaying the time of purchase and another 14% intending to switch brand, it can be seen that close to 40% of buyers would adopt a behaviour that would deliver the most disruptive outcome for their preferred brand.\n\n\nIn the US, the impact of the significant price increases would be even more disruptive—27% would delay the purchase while 37% would switch brand, either within the same segment or down-grading.\n\n\nWhile the UK responses were in reaction to a 20% price increase, the results indicate that US car buyers are particularly price sensitive—over 20% would react in response to a 5% increase while a further 50% would feel the need to re-appraise their vehicle choice if the price hike hit the 15% threshold.\n\n\nSo, What Does This Mean for Auto Manufacturers?\n\n\nSevere price increases imposed via tariffs that brands have no control over create massive market challenges. Margins are already incredibly tight, so significant discounting is akin to commercial self-harming. Promotion of different ownership models may represent a medium to long-term means of mitigating some of these effects.\n\n\nFor any car buyer, there is always a personal value for “money equation” to be satisfied—in other words, balancing what the buyer gets for what they have to pay for it. While geo-politics might influence the “pay” side of the equation, manufacturers can always influence the “what the buyer gets” element by ensuring they build as much equity as they can into their make/model proposition. This translates into ensuring that, through all forms of marketing communications, manufacturers sharply focus on projecting to potential consumers the most influential and resonating benefits that are present in both the brand and the models.\n\n\nThere is never a bad time to reinforce the equity in a brand or its vehicles—but at a time when there is a risk of disruptive pricing, it becomes even more imperative.\n\n\nOur \nAutomotive & Mobility\n team is deeply embedded in the global auto industry as it undergoes ever-growing disruption and transformation. \nFeel free to send us a note with your questions and challenges—we can help you get ahead of the curve of this dynamic market.\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nThis blog post references data from two Escalent studies. In one, Escalent interviewed a US-based sample of 998 consumers aged 18 and up in October 2019, of which 901 intend to purchase/lease a vehicle in the future.\xa0Respondents were recruited from the Dynata and Ipsos panels of US adults and were interviewed online.\xa0Quotas were put in place to achieve a sample of age, gender, income, and ethnicity that matches the demographics of the US population.\xa0In the other, Escalent interviewed a UK-based sample of 293 consumers in October 2019 who had bought/leased a passenger vehicle in the last\xa0three years (all passenger vehicle brands and segments were included).\xa0Respondents were recruited from the Dynata and Toluna panels of UK adults and were interviewed online.\xa0Due to their opt-in nature, these online panels (like most others) do not yield a random probability sample of the target population.\xa0As such, it is not possible to compute a margin of error or to statistically quantify the accuracy of projections.

What is reported by one function does not match what is shared by another. This confuses your ability to see reality and act on it effectively.\n\n\nYou need a dashboard strategy: \n Integrating all your datasets into one validated and approved source of data will provide clarity and reliable insights.\n\n\n5. You Need Multiple Reports for Different Audiences\n\n\nYour audiences’ needs are vastly different. They want to see the data from different angles. What is critical for one is not for others. You need a way to filter, cut, and slice data in multiple ways. Do you wish you could easily customize reports for all?\n\n\nYou need a dashboard strategy: \nWith interactive dashboards, customized reporting is simple.

"What challenges do landlords face when installing EV charging infrastructure for tenants in multifamily housing, considering visibility, cost, and potential tenant dissatisfaction with power sharing?","[' sharing (i.e., if multiple EVs are plugged in, then the charge rate is dynamically lowered). Tenants, however, find this charging style the least appealing. This may present a problem if tenants find power sharing untenable when owning an EV.\n\n\nTwo Important Lessons on EV Charging Infrastructure for Multifamily Housing EV Owners\n\n\nBased on these findings, solving charging for multifamily housing EV owners is not the barrier that many stakeholders believe it is.\n\n\nHowever, it’s also not a fully solved problem and will require further attention from automakers, utilities and policymakers to ensure that multifamily housing residents can participate in and benefit from the e-mobility transition. In this vein, we can learn two main lessons from these findings:\n\n\nLesson 1:\n Continuing to invest in public infrastructure is essential. But it’s not enough to have the infrastructure in place if it’s not visible. Anyone installing charging infrastructure needs to ensure that it’s placed in a visible location and that it has eye-catching branding—avoid the “beige box!” Public infrastructure gives car buyers, regardless of where they live, confidence that they can get a charge when they need it and may play a crucial role in how multifamily housing residents charge.\n\n\nLesson 2:\n Landlords face a balancing act in installing infrastructure for their residents. Tenants who own an EV want a dedicated place to plug in their vehicle, but provisioning dedicated plugs in large parking lots or garages is expensive and risks incurring significant demand charges from the electric utility. Landlords will need to develop phasing plans that allow them to build infrastructure as EV ownership among their tenants grows organically and these plans should include discussion with their utility about ensuring sufficient electric charging capability.\n\n\nFor more details on how multifamily housing residents and their landlords are thinking about EV charging, click below to discover more about our \nEVs for EVeryone\n report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nAbout the EVs for EVeryone Study\n\n\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of 15,553 consumers age 18 to 99 between June 23 and August 24, 2023. Respondents were recruited from multiple opt-in online panels of US adults and were interviewed online. The data were weighted by age, gender, race and household income to match the demographics of the US adult population. Any reported margins of error or significance tests are estimated and rely on the same statistical assumptions as data collected from a random probability sample. Escalent will supply the exact wording of any survey question upon request.', 'In our discussions with electric vehicle (EV) stakeholders, including automakers, utilities and policymakers, we often hear concerns about how people who live in multifamily housing (i.e., apartments and condominiums) can charge their EVs and whether that presents a barrier to adoption.\n\n\nOur recent \nEVs for EVeryone\n study found that, nationally, approximately 25% of car buyers live in multifamily housing. However, that national figure disguises areas where multifamily housing is much more prevalent. For example, 39% of respondents in Cook County, Illinois (i.e., Chicago area), and 52% of respondents in New York City live in multifamily housing.\n\n\nParity in EV Charging Infrastructure Availability?\n\n\nOur \nEVForward™ study of the next generation of EV buyers\n has shown how important home charging is to the EV experience—existing EV owners charge at home more than 80% of the time, while EV Intenders anticipate doing 75% of their charging at home. Single-family homeowners’ parking characteristics are well-suited for charging at home—82% park in their garage or driveway and 48% have access to a standard electrical outlet near where they park.\n\n\nMultifamily housing residents’ parking characteristics are markedly different, with parking lot/garage and on-street parking much more the norm:\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to not having driveway or garage parking, more than half of apartment dwellers and one-third of condo dwellers do not have a dedicated parking spot for themselves. Compounding this, only 30% of condo dwellers and 15% of apartment dwellers have access to a standard electrical outlet near where they park.\n\n\nAccess to standard household outlets is problematic for multifamily housing charging, as these outlets only provide roughly three miles of range per hour of charging, which inadequately covers many drivers’ daily driving habits. However, the picture looks better for people who live in multifamily housing when considering access to Level 2 (L2) charging (which provides around 30 miles of range per hour of charging). Approximately 15% of all car buyers report access to L2 charging regardless of where they live. Additionally, apartment and condo dwellers are twice as likely as single-family housing dwellers to have a DC fast charger (which can add upward of 400 miles of range in an hour) available where they park.\n\n\nAs another charging option, 15% of multifamily housing residents say they could walk to and from a location with a household outlet to charge their vehicle and 13% have a Level 2 charger within walking distance. These residents indicate a strong willingness to do this, with a majority (65%) saying they would likely charge someplace within walking distance to their home. However, 43% of multifamily housing residents report they don’t have any electricity charging source within walking distance.\n\n\nThe Impact of EV Charging Infrastructure on EV Ownership and Intent\n\n\nWhile many EV stakeholders believe that multifamily housing residents aren’t currently buying EVs, and thus solving multifamily housing charging is a future issue, we found that people who live in single-family homes, apartments and condos are equally likely to own an EV or plug-in hybrid. Clearly, any challenges multifamily housing residents have with charging an EV are not insurmountable barriers.\n\n\nThere is a strong correlation between noticing charging infrastructure day-to-day and the perceived practicality of owning an EV. Multifamily housing dwellers are more likely than their counterparts in single-family homes to notice charging infrastructure and/or signage.\n\n\n\n\nThis is reflected in perceived EV practicality: overall, apartment and condo dwellers rate EV practicality at 44 on a 0-to-100 scale, while single-family housing dwellers score EV practicality at 42. The likelihood of considering an EV is similarly higher among multifamily housing dwellers than it is among dwellers of single-family homes.\n\n\nA Disconnect Between Landlords and Tenants on EV Charging?\n\n\nWe found that more than half of multifamily housing landlords will likely install EV charging at their properties in the next three years. However, there’s no clear alignment around how they anticipate providing charging—landlords are as likely to install standard household outlets for EV charging as they are to install dedicated full-power L2 chargers.\n\n\nOne-third of multifamily housing residents say the availability of EV charging will be important in choosing where to live when they next move. However, EV charging availability becomes vastly more important for car buyers who say their next vehicle will be an EV, with 77% saying it will be important in their housing choice. These residents say that a dedicated L2 charger for every EV is most appealing to them, followed by having a dedicated household outlet for EV charging.\n\n\nWhile there is broad consensus between multifamily housing landlords and tenants on household outlets and L2 chargers, many landlords say they’re likely to install L2 charging with power']","Landlords face a balancing act in installing infrastructure for their residents.

1. Driving Habits: Understanding BEV drivers’ patterns and habits is crucial for infrastructure planning and for avoiding potential burden on the electrical grid due to rapid charging demands.

2. Charging Infrastructure: Improvement and expansion of charging infrastructure is a primary concern. Consumers expect easy access to charging stations at home, at work and public places. The charging process also needs to be streamlined, as proposed by solutions like automated charging robots.

3. Driving Range: Consumers often have anxiety about the range of BEVs which could limit their adoption. Increasing the driving range to match or closely match conventional vehicles could address this concern.

4. Charging Speed: Charging speed is another major concern. Consumers would need faster charging solutions to accommodate long journeys and reduce waiting time during charging. Companies like BP are working to create a nationwide network of ultrafast chargers to address this issue.

5. Pricing: Pricing of BEVs and charging is also a critical aspect to consider. Regulatory policies and incentives could play a role in reducing prices and making BEVs more affordable. 

Furthermore, consumer education and awareness programs, along with tax benefits and financial incentives, could help accelerate the adoption of BEVs.

Why measure sponsorships and how does it aid in informed sponsorship decisions?,"[' marketers don’t see the value, or worse still, just don’t know how to do it. One of my client-partners recently captured her sponsorship challenges rather succinctly when she said:\n\n\n“Most of us don’t even know where to start. Tallying of press coverage or social media buzz is just so cumbersome and doesn’t really give me anything meaningful. But if I do primary research with our target market, how do I tie that back into our brand research, or reliably link it to the measures that matter to my executives, like sales and profits?” \n\n\nWith this frustration in mind, let’s take a look at the “why” and “how” of good sponsorship measurement.\n\n\nWhy You Need to Measure\n\n\nMore than 100 US companies have sponsorship budgets in excess of $15 million, and the largest sponsors such as Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Nike and Anheuser-Busch spend well in excess of $200 million per annum. Given the size of these investments, the rationale for measurement should be obvious, and includes the following:\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Governance:\n Like any other company expenditure, the sponsorship spend needs to be clearly justified. So doing the research that identifies the causal links between the investment and corporate KPIs and/or financial returns is a critical corporate governance function that marketing is obliged to undertake.\n\n\nProtect your Budget:\n If you want to protect your sponsorship budget for next year, set about proving the value that it’s providing this year. Maintaining a consistent budget is particularly important for sponsorships associated with popular properties (e.g. NFL or MLB) where there are considerably more sponsors, many of whom might have been around for decades. In these instances, it may take years of investment to “break in” and gain consistent awareness and behavioral change with fans.\n\n\nPrioritize Opportunities: \nMost companies spread their budgets between a number of sponsorship properties in order to maximize reach or target disparate audiences. Effective measurement allows you to assess the relative merit of each sponsorship as it relates to corporate goals, allowing you to make informed decisions about which sponsorships to maintain and where to prioritize budget.\n\n\nRenegotiation Power:\n Perhaps the greatest value you’ll see from effective sponsorship measurement is when it comes to renegotiating your sponsorship contract. Having detailed data regarding what works best for your company provides you with far greater power, allowing you to focus on the opportunities that matter and negotiate a cost that you can confidently predict will deliver an ROI. I’ve recently witnessed a client-partner optimize the modules of their sponsorship with a major US sports league while saving nearly $10 million, all through having the right insights.\n\n\n\n\nHow You Should Measure Sponsorships\n\n\nThe ‘how’ is where most marketers get stuck, but, in fact, it’s relatively easy to get started with some fundamentals. The first step is to determine who is going to do the measurement, and if you’re looking for the data to deliver actionable insights and have credibility with your leadership, my strong recommendation is that you hire a team of independent professionals. Don’t let foxes into your henhouse.\n\n\nThe second step is to clearly define your audience on the front end. The audience definition should be relatively obvious—after all, you got into this sponsorship in the first place to reach a specific target segment. Perhaps you’re a tech brand looking to reach a senior business audience at a golf tournament, or maybe you’re an energy drinks brand that is looking to connect with Millennials by sponsoring a series of music concerts.\xa0 Whatever the segment(s), have the demographic profile clearly defined up-front so you can zero in on the impact with the people that matter most to your brand.\n\n\nBut don’t stop there. An even more crucial (but often overlooked) part of audience definition is fan classification, and specifically defining the ‘avidity’ of fans. Typically, you’ll want to define three fan classes:\n\n\n\n\nAvid fans\n who are deeply involved in the sponsorship property through regular attendance or viewership of events, as well as other engagement (e.g. online, social media)\n\n\nCasual fans\n who have more of a passing interest\n\n\nNon-fans\n who have no interest at all\n\n\n\n\nUsing fan classes to break out different audience segments in your research will allow you to benchmark your impact based upon the level of engagement with the sponsorship property, see how closely your target market matches the fan base and, ultimately, measure the lift that is achieved over the general population.\n\n\n\n\nTop Tip: Define Your Avid Fan Up-Front\n\n\nHow do you determine if a person is an ‘avid’ fan? The truth is, it can vary greatly from one sponsorship property to another.']","Measurement of sponsorships is important for several reasons.

"What key capabilities of BEVs need to be addressed for widespread adoption, including driving habits, charging infrastructure, driving range, charging speed, and pricing?","['EV Potential Not Yet Realized\n\n\nAs we look back on the past decade, I think most of us would acknowledge that it has been a period of tremendous business innovation and industry disruption, whether that be Uber and Lyft upending the taxicab industry, Airbnb undercutting the hotel industry, or streaming video services that have caused consumers to abandon cable and satellite services.\n\n\nIn the coming decade, it seems clear that another industry that will undergo tremendous change is the automotive industry. In particular, auto manufacturers have already started to embrace and invest in technology that will profoundly affect the industry, transportation infrastructure and on consumers themselves: electric vehicles (EVs).\n\n\nThe potential benefits of EVs are numerous and important. Given the increasing threats of climate change, EVs represent a critical step in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and in bettering our environment. In addition, EVs will provide consumers with lower operating and maintenance costs as compared to conventional vehicles.\n\n\nAt the same time, the trade-offs and barriers to EV adoption are also significant. Range anxiety (i.e., the worry that an EV won’t travel a sufficient distance on a single charge) has been a consistent concern of consumers since EVs’ inception. Additionally, even with the fastest chargers, charging times far exceed the five minutes it takes to fill up the gas tank of vehicles with internal combustion engines. Furthermore, while the number of public charging stations has increased significantly over time, they are still limited in number and would likely be insufficient to meet any major, short-term spike in EVs on the road.\n\n\nAuto\n manufacturers and \ntech\n firms have been working hard to reduce these barriers. Batteries and electronics design have improved to the point where some of the latest models tout driving ranges of nearly 400 miles. Apps are now available to identify the location and availability of public charging stations. Public fast-charging stations are now able to recharge up to 80% of a vehicle’s battery in 30 minutes, and various organizations are working on initiatives to reduce charging times further.\n\n\nWhile the adoption of EVs has grown over time, \nEV sales in the US still represent less than 2%\n of the total vehicle market. So, with all of these improvements and the environmental and cost benefits of EVs, why haven’t EV sales been booming? In addition, have tech initiatives really overcome the EV barriers they set out to address? I have some opinions based on my own experience.\n\n\nFunctional Benefits Aren’t Always Enough\n\n\nWhen conducting consumer interviews last year on a wide range of topics including the steps that consumers would willingly take to combat climate change, I asked about the appeal of EVs. Most respondents were notably lukewarm to the general category, yet immediately added as an afterthought, “Now Tesla. That’s an EV that I could get excited about!” In probing further, the interest in Tesla wasn’t based so much on its environmental benefits, but rather its sleek, sexy styling and “cool” image. Given that the styling and image are combined with impressive battery \ntechnology\n and a host of tech features, it is little wonder that Tesla has dominated the US EV market.\n\n\nThe Chevy Bolt is the second most popular EV in the US, but still suffered an almost 9% drop in sales this past year. \n\xa0In its marketing materials, Chevy emphasizes the Bolt’s impressive driving range, low cost of ownership, safety and several other features. My middle brother, a proud Chevy Bolt owner, validates that these claims are true, but he also stresses an emotional benefit that Chevy fails to tout: the Bolt \nis fun to drive\n. With much more torque than internal combustion engines, the Bolt (and EVs in general) can accelerate faster, which makes merging with and maneuvering around traffic easier and more enjoyable. Yet, when it comes to marketing, Chevy appears to be promoting the Bolt on its functional and practical merits only rather than including an appeal to any emotional motivators (i.e., being fun to drive).\n\n\nCharging: Not as Simple as it Seems\n\n\nA little over a year ago, my Chevy Bolt-owning brother decided that he wanted to see if we could make the drive from the San Francisco Bay Area to Lake Tahoe. Knowing that the Bolt couldn’t reach the destination on a single charge, my brother’s first task was to figure out where one could find charging stations along the way. So, unlike traveling in a conventional vehicle with easy access to ubiquitous gas stations along the way, it became clear that EV charging would be more challenging because it involves up-front planning (e.g., knowing how far your vehicle can go, where charging stations are located, and being smart about when to stop to recharge).\n\n\nAfter mapping out the trip and checking his charging station app, my brother came up with a plan to drive to a station about halfway to our destination. With our charging', 'The “Automotive Revolution” has arrived – not with a bang, but with silence. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) – with their emission-free, high-torque benefits – have already become ubiquitous on the streets of the world’s largest cities.\n\n\nInjected into the consciousness by Tesla, which made BEVs cool and sporty while boosting their range between charging cycles, BEVs are finding their way into the hands of a growing number of consumers. In 2018, more than \n2.1 million new car buyers\n around the world chose battery power – motivated by energy-consciousness, the cool factor, or simply being the early adopter for new technologies.\n\n\nAt the same time, it’s still unclear who will be the target buyer for the new generation of BEVs. Though actor Tom Hanks once famously and proudly proclaimed that he drives a BEV “to save America,” such altruism is not universal, especially when it comes at a premium.\n\n\nAlso, manufacturers are still rolling out BEVs that are “less than” – forcing compromises that some members of the car-buying public may feel are simply not worth it. Suffice it to say, finding the balance between actual driving needs and current BEV capabilities will be key to widespread adoption of BEVs.\n\n\nAmong the questions that must be answered satisfactorily for the public to broadly accept BEVs into their lives:\n\n\n1. What do I have to do differently to drive a BEV?\n\n\nTesla aside, many of the current generation of BEVs have required compromises that aren’t always palatable to a public that is well served with current products. BEVs tend to have unusual, polarizing styling cues, and are small in stature, compromising passenger and cargo space for the sake of efficiency. Additionally, fully committing to a BEV means that drivers will have to refine their pedal-stomping, race-from-red driving habits to optimize the range on a charge.\n\n\nManufacturers seem to be heeding the public’s desire for BEVs that blend in. Hyundai’s Kona crossover SUV and the remodeled Nissan Leaf have been styled in the ilk of more traditional offerings – and have been met with accolades as a result.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n2. Where do I plug in?\n\n\nToday, there are more than 67,000 charging stations across the United States, with more opening daily. But there are 168,000 gas stations, which means drivers will likely have to cover significant ground to find a place to “charge up.” Though consumers will get the best charge via a dedicated, proprietary charging connection, many of today’s BEVs can be charged in a pinch (albeit slowly) through typical household current.\n\n\nOf course, you \ncan\n install a fast charger in your own garage; the \nnational average cost for installation\n is around $1,200. For many, charging at home is one of the greatest benefits of having a BEV.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n3. How far can I drive on a full charge?\n\n\nThough this has improved significantly, there’s still a way to go. GM’s first fully electrified vehicles, which hit roadways in the early 1990s, needed a charge every 70 to 80 miles – barely enough for the daily in-town grind, and certainly too stingy for road warriors. Today’s mass market BEVs can cover about 200 miles between plug-ins, and some newer products are even promising 400 miles.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n4. I can fill my gas tank in three minutes – why can’t I charge as fast?\n\n\nCharging technologies, though improved, still haven’t leveled the playing field with fossil-fueled counterparts. The typical home charger can only muster a full charge every 6-8 hours; and fast chargers in the wild can cut that to just a couple of hours (Tesla’s Supercharger technology cuts the full-charging time to just 30 minutes). New battery-charging technologies are being tested that will reduce the charging time to 15 minutes, but it’s important to note that both battery and charging infrastructure will have to be modified to deliver the benefits.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n5. Will prices come down?\n\n\nThis is a function of several factors – improved battery technology as well as government rebates and tax credits certainly will help, but consumer adoption will have the biggest downward pressure on price. It’s truly a chicken-and-egg paradigm – volume will ultimately drive discounts. Consider that the major manufacturers are spinning out millions of gas-powered cars each year – if BEV sales comprise only a small percentage of that total, you have to pass along more of the manufacturing and research charges to the consumer.\n\n\nThat said, more than half of US BEV sales in 2018 were racked up by one car']","The key capabilities of BEVs that need to be addressed for widespread adoption include driving habits, charging infrastructure, driving range, charging speed, and pricing.",reasoning,"[{'title': 'The Challenges of Making EV Easy', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/the-challenges-of-making-ev-easy/'}, {'title': 'Have Plug, Will Travel – The Battery Electric Vehicle Revolution Has Arrived', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/have-plug-will-travel-the-battery-electric-vehicle-bev-revolution-has-arrived/'}]",True,"For widespread adoption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), several key capabilities need to be addressed:

1. Driving Habits: Understanding BEV drivers’ patterns and habits is crucial for infrastructure planning and for avoiding potential burden on the electrical grid due to rapid charging demands.

2. Charging Infrastructure: Improvement and expansion of charging infrastructure is a primary concern. Consumers expect easy access to charging stations at home, at work and public places. The charging process also needs to be streamlined, as proposed by solutions like automated charging robots.

3. Driving Range: Consumers often have anxiety about the range of BEVs which could limit their adoption. Increasing the driving range to match or closely match conventional vehicles could address this concern.

4. Charging Speed: Charging speed is another major concern. Consumers would need faster charging solutions to accommodate long journeys and reduce waiting time during charging. Companies like BP are working to create a nationwide network of ultrafast chargers to address this issue.

5. Pricing: Pricing of BEVs and charging is also a critical aspect to consider. Regulatory policies and incentives could play a role in reducing prices and making BEVs more affordable. 

Furthermore, consumer education and awareness programs, along with tax benefits and financial incentives, could help accelerate the adoption of BEVs.

In terms of buyer personas, they identified six unique European EV buyer personas and their likelihood to adopt EVs. Understanding these personas can guide businesses in tailoring their marketing and product strategies to different consumer groups. 

As for charging infrastructure, findings from the 2022 EVForward™ Charging Infrastructure DeepDive reveal that while home refueling tends to be preferred, robust public charging infrastructure is vital for quelling range anxiety and encouraging wider adoption of EVs. They point out the need for compatibility and reliability in public charging stations, indicating that consumers value both convenience and universality. They also emphasize that visibility in route planning software and in-vehicle navigation is crucial for businesses aiming to attract traffic from EV drivers.

Moreover, EVForward highlights the opportunity for home charging providers, including auto manufacturers and dealerships. They also note that while consumers haven't picked a favorite public charging brand yet, Tesla has achieved the highest level of recognition. This suggests room for other companies to increase their brand visibility and recognition in the public charging market.

These insights can help businesses better position their EV and EV-related offerings, fine-tune customer experiences, and develop strategies for both home and public charging solutions.","['evforward', 'offers', 'comprehensive', 'consumer', 'personas', 'and', 'deepdives', 'on', 'topics', 'like', 'charging', 'infrastructure', 'to', 'provide', 'actionable', 'insights', 'for', 'businesses', 'in', 'the', 'ev', 'marketplace', '.']","['evforward', 'offers', 'significant', 'insights', 'to', 'businesses', 'in', 'the', 'ev', 'marketplace', 'through', 'their', 'thorough', 'research', 'on', 'consumer', 'personas', 'and', 'deep', 'dives', 'into', 'topics', 'like', 'charging', 'infrastructure', '.', 'in', 'terms', 'of', 'buyer', 'personas', ',', 'they', 'identified', 'six', 'unique', 'european', 'ev', 'buyer', 'personas', 'and', 'their', 'likelihood', 'to', 'adopt', 'evs', '.', 'understanding', 'these', 'personas', 'can', 'guide', 'businesses', 'in', 'tailoring', 'their', 'marketing', 'and', 'product', 'strategies', 'to', 'different', 'consumer', 'groups', '.', 'as', 'for', 'charging', 'infrastructure', ',', 'findings', 'from', 'the', '2022', 'evforward™', 'charging', 'infrastructure', 'deepdive', 'reveal', 'that', 'while', 'home', 'refueling', 'tends', 'to', 'be', 'preferred', ',', 'robust', 'public', 'charging', 'infrastructure', 'is', 'vital', 'for', 'quelling', 'range', 'anxiety', 'and', 'encouraging', 'wider', 'adoption', 'of', 'evs', '.', 'they', 'point', 'out', 'the', 'need', 'for', 'compatibility', 'and', 'reliability', 'in', 'public', 'charging', 'stations', ',', 'indicating', 'that', 'consumers', 'value', 'both', 'convenience', 'and', 'universality', '.', 'they', 'also', 'emphasize', 'that', 'visibility', 'in', 'route', 'planning', 'software', 'and', 'in-vehicle', 'navigation', 'is', 'crucial', 'for', 'businesses', 'aiming', 'to', 'attract', 'traffic', 'from', 'ev', 'drivers', '.', 'moreover', ',', 'evforward', 'highlights', 'the', 'opportunity', 'for', 'home', 'charging', 'providers', ',', 'including', 'auto', 'manufacturers', 'and', 'dealerships', '.', 'they', 'also', 'note', 'that', 'while', 'consumers', 'have', ""n't"", 'picked', 'a', 'favorite', 'public', 'charging', 'brand', 'yet', ',', 'tesla', 'has', 'achieved', 'the', 'highest', 'level', 'of', 'recognition', '.', 'this', 'suggests', 'room', 'for', 'other', 'companies', 'to', 'increase', 'their', 'brand', 'visibility', 'and', 'recognition', 'in', 'the', 'public', 'charging', 'market', '.', 'these', 'insights', 'can', 'help', 'businesses', 'better', 'position', 'their', 'ev', 'and', 'ev-related', 'offerings', ',', 'fine-tune', 'customer', 'experiences', ',', 'and', 'develop', 'strategies', 'for', 'both', 'home', 'and', 'public', 'charging', 'solutions', '.']",0.032700463785272,0.1963190160698558,0.82495314,0.9048086,0.8630376,"Organizations can ensure a comprehensive view of market landscapes and navigate successfully by conducting thorough market research.

In the automotive industry, it has led to a decline in vehicle sales, a shift in consumer preferences and a financial crisis for many families. As such, industry players need to reconsider their strategies to navigate these sudden changes.

One of the emerging strategies is the accelerated development of connected car services and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). The decline in vehicle sales has prompted auto manufacturers to fast track the expansion of these services. Connected car services offer manufacturers a chance at reaping greater benefits and profits in the near future by engaging consumers with digital experiences that may compel them to pay for subscriptions.

At the dealership level, the pandemic has forced many dealers to switch to a digital vehicle acquisition process. This adaptation positions them to better support manufacturers as they expand their connected services.

Finally, there has been an increased demand for pre-owned vehicles as consumers look to save money during the financial crisis. This demand is beneficial for both dealers and consumers with a potential win-win scenario.

Massive price increases imposed by tariffs disrupt the pricing hierarchy of vehicle brands, causing a potential for preferred brands to become unaffordable for customers. Additionally, manufacturers already operate with tight margins, so discounting to offset these tariffs equates to financial self-harm.

In response to huge overnight price hikes, buyer behavior is likely to change significantly. A small scale study conducted in the UK and US found that only a small percentage of buyers would stick with their original car make/model preference if faced with a large price increase. In the UK, only 17% would stay with their original choice while in the US a significant price increase would prompt 27% to delay the purchase and 37% to switch brands. Furthermore, the study shows US car buyers are particularly price sensitive, with over 20% reacting in response to a 5% increase and a 50% re-appraising their vehicle choice if the price increase hit a 15% threshold. 

Manufacturers can attempt to mitigate these effects by promoting different ownership models or by building equity into their make/model proposition, projecting influential and resonating benefits to potential consumers through marketing communications.",1.0,0.9462051039535062,0.9999999999666668,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.6999999992999999,0.942001262675124,0.5816541618226272
"How can organizations ensure a comprehensive view of market landscapes and navigate successfully, considering industry experts and the big picture?","['ary Market Research: \nTapping into the vast array of information and data available in the public domain is another key to gaining a more comprehensive view of markets. As this information often comes from multiple sources and is broadly focused, secondary research is an excellent resource for gaining big picture perspective, such as market trends.\n\n\nAdvisory Services: \nBecause they are staffed with industry experts who are very familiar with their respective industries, competitors, and products, Advisory Services are an important piece of an organization’s market insights approach. As big picture experts, advisory service analysts use their deep industry knowledge to provide a comprehensive view of market landscapes.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, when it comes to establishing a successful Corporate GPS, firms need to develop a broad understanding of their overall landscape so that they can successfully navigate within it. By so doing, organizations will be able to leverage opportunities, mitigate challenges, and evolve and even transform over time.\n\n\nWe’d love to discuss how we could work together to develop a successful Corporate GPS plan for your organization.', 'We all have our favorite mobile apps, but I can say without hesitation that GPS has been a game changer for me. Some may remember GPS in its infancy when users would print MapQuest directions from their computers before setting off on a trip. Those of a certain age will also remember unfolding and squinting at their trusty paper maps while trying to locate a current location and a planned destination.\n\n\nOf course, navigation is much easier now. When I need to get to a new location, I pull up Google Maps or Waze on my phone, and they instantly find the most direct route, the miles I need to travel, and the duration of my trip. Voice directions allow me to keep my eyes on the road while still be alerted about the turns and exits I need to take. And when there is an accident and traffic has come to a standstill, today’s GPS can inform me of the best ways to circumvent the problem and get me on my way. So, in what ways have I benefited from GPS? It’s offered fast, easy, and effective directions on the fly while limiting the number of opportunities to get lost. Without a doubt, GPS has proven invaluable in getting me from Point A to Point B.\n\n\nAnd yet, in using GPS, I often find that I have less of a feel for the area in which I travel. GPS may provide a reliable series of instructions telling me when to turn left or right, but I frequently find that in using GPS, I lose a “big picture” context (i.e., where I am within a larger area, especially in relation to other cities, highways, and landmarks). In contrast, those paper maps of days gone by gave me a much better sense of where my travels fit within the overall landscape.\n\n\nLosing Big Picture Context\n\n\nI see my GPS experience as a reasonable metaphor that can apply to just about any organization. So often businesses are under tremendous pressure to make detailed decisions about very specific projects, programs, and objectives. In these cases, there is frequently a sense of urgency in figuring out how to get from Point A to Point B (e.g., from today’s current product to tomorrow’s new product) without getting lost or wasting a lot of time and money. The focus is often narrowly focused on an immediate destination (e.g., the next product) and determining the best path to get there as quickly and efficiently as possible. Such efforts are important and often critical to an organization’s success.\n\n\nHowever, sometimes corporations plan these destinations while also having lost track of their own big picture context. These firms begin their journey only to discover that they are now operating in a different landscape. They learn that changing economic conditions, industry dynamics, customer preferences, and/or competitive initiatives have created roadblocks that limit their progress. Or they complete their journey only to find that others have a better understanding of the overall market “map” and have found a better, faster, more innovative route to success.\n\n\nAuthor and strategist Annie Duke points to Sony and Apple as examples of this phenomena. Many years back, Sony reflected on the success that its Walkman tape and CD players had experienced and determined that they should continue on the path of enhancing these products rather than replace them. In contrast, Apple recognized that the market and technology landscape had changed and introduced the digital iPod as a result. Before long, Apple became the dominant player in the portable music market while Sony occupied a diminished market position.\n\n\nNavigating Market Disruption Successfully\n\n\nSo how can organizations be smart about developing their own “Corporate GPS?” How can these firms ensure that they see the forest for the trees and are able to navigate their markets successfully? And what can these organizations do when the landscape begins to look disrupted and unfamiliar?\n\n\nThe key is to adopt well-rounded, ongoing efforts to monitor and research the trends and opportunities associated with the larger market context, while also investigating promising, close-in opportunities. \xa0While that advice may sound reasonable in a general sense, you may wonder how that translates into specific, practical actions that you and your organization could take.\n\n\nGaining a big picture concept means adopting a global perspective while also engaging in a comprehensive, in-depth approach to developing market insights. There are four keys to Corporate GPS success:\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Perspective: \nOpportunities often abound (as do threats) outside the lens that firms sometimes apply to themselves. By thinking more broadly about markets served and products offered, organizations will better understand how they can adapt and thrive in an ever-changing landscape.\n\n\nPrimary Market Research: \nWhen it comes to understanding the needs, motivations, and behaviors of customers, no one is better suited to provide these insights than customers themselves. Research that addresses a customized set of issues with a specific target audience provides the kind of in-depth insights necessary for both near-term and long-term decision making.\n\n\nSecond']","Organizations can ensure a comprehensive view of market landscapes and navigate successfully by adopting a global perspective, engaging in primary market research to understand customer needs and behaviors, utilizing the expertise of industry experts through advisory services, and conducting secondary research to gain a big picture perspective of market trends.",reasoning,"[{'title': 'Corporate GPS: Seeing The Forest For The Trees', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/corporate-gps-seeing-the-forest-for-the-trees/'}, {'title': 'Corporate GPS: Seeing The Forest For The Trees', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/corporate-gps-seeing-the-forest-for-the-trees/'}]",True,"Organizations can ensure a comprehensive view of market landscapes and navigate successfully by conducting thorough market research.

Firstly, their parking characteristics are significantly different from those of single-family homeowners. Instead of having driveway or garage parking, multifamily housing residents mostly rely on parking lots, garages, or on-street parking. Furthermore, more than half of apartment dwellers and one-third of condo dwellers do not have a dedicated parking spot for themselves.

Access to a standard electrical outlet, necessary for EV charging, is also more limited for these residents. Only 30% of condo dwellers and 15% of apartment dwellers have access to a standard electrical outlet near where they park. Although the accessibility of Level 2 (L2) charging and DC fast chargers is comparatively better, the limitations of standard outlets could still pose a significant issue.

For landlords, the findings suggest that over half are likely to install EV charging at their properties in the next three years. However, some might resort to power sharing, which tenants found the least appealing. Therefore, landlords need to consider the preferences of their tenants when installing charging infrastructure.

For tenants, particularly those intending to buy an EV as their next vehicle, the availability of EV charging becomes a crucial factor in choosing where to live.

What market challenges do auto manufacturers face due to tariffs and how might it affect car buyers' behavior?,"['In both the UK and US, there is currently a real risk for political dynamics to result in the imposition of trade tariffs that have selective, disruptive effects on various product categories.\n\n\nTraditionally, vehicle manufacturers have been able to introduce modest price rises almost indiscernibly. Sometimes, currency fluctuations may also serve to inflate prices but, critically, neither mechanism tends to disrupt the pricing hierarchy.\n\n\nIf sizeable tariffs are applied to vehicle brands from specific countries or regions, there is potential for the pricing hierarchy of brands to be massively disrupted.\n\n\nSo, how might car buyers react to massive overnight price hikes for various car brands? We conducted a small scale, attitudinal study in the UK and US to determine what car buyers would actually do in various scenarios.\n\n\nIt is clear in both countries that, faced with a discernibly higher price, car buyer behaviour would scatter in all sorts of different directions. In the UK, only 17% of car buyers would stick with their original make/model preference. A further one third would likely stay with their preferred brand but also seek a means of mitigating the price increase by down-grading on trim levels or segment. With one quarter delaying the time of purchase and another 14% intending to switch brand, it can be seen that close to 40% of buyers would adopt a behaviour that would deliver the most disruptive outcome for their preferred brand.\n\n\nIn the US, the impact of the significant price increases would be even more disruptive—27% would delay the purchase while 37% would switch brand, either within the same segment or down-grading.\n\n\nWhile the UK responses were in reaction to a 20% price increase, the results indicate that US car buyers are particularly price sensitive—over 20% would react in response to a 5% increase while a further 50% would feel the need to re-appraise their vehicle choice if the price hike hit the 15% threshold.\n\n\nSo, What Does This Mean for Auto Manufacturers?\n\n\nSevere price increases imposed via tariffs that brands have no control over create massive market challenges. Margins are already incredibly tight, so significant discounting is akin to commercial self-harming. Promotion of different ownership models may represent a medium to long-term means of mitigating some of these effects.\n\n\nFor any car buyer, there is always a personal value for “money equation” to be satisfied—in other words, balancing what the buyer gets for what they have to pay for it. While geo-politics might influence the “pay” side of the equation, manufacturers can always influence the “what the buyer gets” element by ensuring they build as much equity as they can into their make/model proposition. This translates into ensuring that, through all forms of marketing communications, manufacturers sharply focus on projecting to potential consumers the most influential and resonating benefits that are present in both the brand and the models.\n\n\nThere is never a bad time to reinforce the equity in a brand or its vehicles—but at a time when there is a risk of disruptive pricing, it becomes even more imperative.\n\n\nOur \nAutomotive & Mobility\n team is deeply embedded in the global auto industry as it undergoes ever-growing disruption and transformation. \nFeel free to send us a note with your questions and challenges—we can help you get ahead of the curve of this dynamic market.\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nThis blog post references data from two Escalent studies.

Massive price increases imposed by tariffs disrupt the pricing hierarchy of vehicle brands, causing a potential for preferred brands to become unaffordable for customers. Additionally, manufacturers already operate with tight margins, so discounting to offset these tariffs equates to financial self-harm.

In response to huge overnight price hikes, buyer behavior is likely to change significantly. A small scale study conducted in the UK and US found that only a small percentage of buyers would stick with their original car make/model preference if faced with a large price increase. In the UK, only 17% would stay with their original choice while in the US a significant price increase would prompt 27% to delay the purchase and 37% to switch brands. Furthermore, the study shows US car buyers are particularly price sensitive, with over 20% reacting in response to a 5% increase and a 50% re-appraising their vehicle choice if the price increase hit a 15% threshold. 

Manufacturers can attempt to mitigate these effects by promoting different ownership models or by building equity into their make/model proposition, projecting influential and resonating benefits to potential consumers through marketing communications.","['severe', 'price', 'increases', 'imposed', 'via', 'tariffs', 'that', 'brands', 'have', 'no', 'control', 'over', 'create', 'massive', 'market', 'challenges', 'for', 'auto', 'manufacturers', '.', 'car', 'buyers', ""'"", 'behavior', 'may', 'be', 'affected', 'by', 'these', 'price', 'increases', ',', 'with', 'a', 'significant', 'percentage', 'delaying', 'their', 'purchase', 'or', 'switching', 'to', 'a', 'different', 'brand', 'or', 'segment', '.', 'the', 'pricing', 'hierarchy', 'of', 'brands', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'disrupted', '.']","['auto', 'manufacturers', 'face', 'significant', 'market', 'challenges', 'due', 'to', 'tariffs', '.', 'massive', 'price', 'increases', 'imposed', 'by', 'tariffs', 'disrupt', 'the', 'pricing', 'hierarchy', 'of', 'vehicle', 'brands', ',', 'causing', 'a', 'potential', 'for', 'preferred', 'brands', 'to', 'become', 'unaffordable', 'for', 'customers', '.', 'additionally', ',', 'manufacturers', 'already', 'operate', 'with', 'tight', 'margins', ',', 'so', 'discounting', 'to', 'offset', 'these', 'tariffs', 'equates', 'to', 'financial', 'self-harm', '.', 'in', 'response', 'to', 'huge', 'overnight', 'price', 'hikes', ',', 'buyer', 'behavior', 'is', 'likely', 'to', 'change', 'significantly', '.', 'a', 'small', 'scale', 'study', 'conducted', 'in', 'the', 'uk', 'and', 'us', 'found', 'that', 'only', 'a', 'small', 'percentage', 'of', 'buyers', 'would', 'stick', 'with', 'their', 'original', 'car', 'make/model', 'preference', 'if', 'faced', 'with', 'a', 'large', 'price', 'increase', '.', 'in', 'the', 'uk', ',', 'only', '17', '%', 'would', 'stay', 'with', 'their', 'original', 'choice', 'while', 'in', 'the', 'us', 'a', 'significant', 'price', 'increase', 'would', 'prompt', '27', '%', 'to', 'delay', 'the', 'purchase', 'and', '37', '%', 'to', 'switch', 'brands', '.', 'furthermore', ',', 'the', 'study', 'shows', 'us', 'car', 'buyers', 'are', 'particularly', 'price', 'sensitive', ',', 'with', 'over', '20', '%', 'reacting', 'in', 'response', 'to', 'a', '5', '%', 'increase', 'and', 'a', '50', '%', 're-appraising', 'their', 'vehicle', 'choice', 'if', 'the', 'price', 'increase', 'hit', 'a', '15', '%', 'threshold', '.', 'manufacturers', 'can', 'attempt', 'to', 'mitigate', 'these', 'effects', 'by', 'promoting', 'different', 'ownership', 'models', 'or', 'by', 'building', 'equity', 'into', 'their', 'make/model', 'proposition', ',', 'projecting', 'influential', 'and', 'resonating', 'benefits', 'to', 'potential', 'consumers', 'through', 'marketing', 'communications', '.']",0.0280911432687442,0.2658959497998597,0.84590304,0.90152705,0.87282974,"Landlords of multifamily housing face certain challenges when providing EV charging infrastructure for their tenants. One such challenge is the discrepancy between the types of chargers landlords are likely to install and those that tenants find most appealing. While landlords are as likely to install standard household outlets as they are to install full-power L2 chargers, their tenants, especially those who own an EV, prefer having a dedicated L2 charger for every EV. 

Moreover, many landlords consider installing L2 charging with power sharing, whereby if multiple EVs are plugged in, the charge rate is dynamically lowered. However, this charging style is reportedly the least appealing for tenants. This could become an issue if tenants find this power sharing arrangement untenable when owning an EV.

In terms of balancing the needs of EV-owning tenants with the costs and demand charges of installing dedicated charging stations, there are a couple of approaches. Firstly, landlords need to develop phasing plans to gradually build infrastructure as EV ownership among their tenants naturally increases. These plans should include discussions with their utility company to ensure sufficient electric charging capability. 

Secondly, continued investment in public infrastructure is critical. Public infrastructure can give car buyers confidence that they can get a charge when they need it, regardless of where they live. Hence, it might play a vital role in how multifamily housing residents charge their EVs. This could lessen the pressure on landlords to urgently provide comprehensive charging solutions and provide them with more time to install the infrastructure in a cost-effective manner.",1.0,0.9662431742204022,0.99999999995,0.5,1.0,0.874999999453125,0.9352361795104924,0.3838090448776231
"What challenges do people in multifamily housing face with EV ownership and charging, and what are the implications for landlords and tenants?","['In our discussions with electric vehicle (EV) stakeholders, including automakers, utilities and policymakers, we often hear concerns about how people who live in multifamily housing (i.e., apartments and condominiums) can charge their EVs and whether that presents a barrier to adoption.\n\n\nOur recent \nEVs for EVeryone\n study found that, nationally, approximately 25% of car buyers live in multifamily housing. However, that national figure disguises areas where multifamily housing is much more prevalent. For example, 39% of respondents in Cook County, Illinois (i.e., Chicago area), and 52% of respondents in New York City live in multifamily housing.\n\n\nParity in EV Charging Infrastructure Availability?\n\n\nOur \nEVForward™ study of the next generation of EV buyers\n has shown how important home charging is to the EV experience—existing EV owners charge at home more than 80% of the time, while EV Intenders anticipate doing 75% of their charging at home. Single-family homeowners’ parking characteristics are well-suited for charging at home—82% park in their garage or driveway and 48% have access to a standard electrical outlet near where they park.\n\n\nMultifamily housing residents’ parking characteristics are markedly different, with parking lot/garage and on-street parking much more the norm:\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to not having driveway or garage parking, more than half of apartment dwellers and one-third of condo dwellers do not have a dedicated parking spot for themselves. Compounding this, only 30% of condo dwellers and 15% of apartment dwellers have access to a standard electrical outlet near where they park.\n\n\nAccess to standard household outlets is problematic for multifamily housing charging, as these outlets only provide roughly three miles of range per hour of charging, which inadequately covers many drivers’ daily driving habits. However, the picture looks better for people who live in multifamily housing when considering access to Level 2 (L2) charging (which provides around 30 miles of range per hour of charging). Approximately 15% of all car buyers report access to L2 charging regardless of where they live. Additionally, apartment and condo dwellers are twice as likely as single-family housing dwellers to have a DC fast charger (which can add upward of 400 miles of range in an hour) available where they park.\n\n\nAs another charging option, 15% of multifamily housing residents say they could walk to and from a location with a household outlet to charge their vehicle and 13% have a Level 2 charger within walking distance. These residents indicate a strong willingness to do this, with a majority (65%) saying they would likely charge someplace within walking distance to their home. However, 43% of multifamily housing residents report they don’t have any electricity charging source within walking distance.\n\n\nThe Impact of EV Charging Infrastructure on EV Ownership and Intent\n\n\nWhile many EV stakeholders believe that multifamily housing residents aren’t currently buying EVs, and thus solving multifamily housing charging is a future issue, we found that people who live in single-family homes, apartments and condos are equally likely to own an EV or plug-in hybrid. Clearly, any challenges multifamily housing residents have with charging an EV are not insurmountable barriers.\n\n\nThere is a strong correlation between noticing charging infrastructure day-to-day and the perceived practicality of owning an EV. Multifamily housing dwellers are more likely than their counterparts in single-family homes to notice charging infrastructure and/or signage.\n\n\n\n\nThis is reflected in perceived EV practicality: overall, apartment and condo dwellers rate EV practicality at 44 on a 0-to-100 scale, while single-family housing dwellers score EV practicality at 42. The likelihood of considering an EV is similarly higher among multifamily housing dwellers than it is among dwellers of single-family homes.\n\n\nA Disconnect Between Landlords and Tenants on EV Charging?\n\n\nWe found that more than half of multifamily housing landlords will likely install EV charging at their properties in the next three years. However, there’s no clear alignment around how they anticipate providing charging—landlords are as likely to install standard household outlets for EV charging as they are to install dedicated full-power L2 chargers.\n\n\nOne-third of multifamily housing residents say the availability of EV charging will be important in choosing where to live when they next move. However, EV charging availability becomes vastly more important for car buyers who say their next vehicle will be an EV, with 77% saying it will be important in their housing choice. These residents say that a dedicated L2 charger for every EV is most appealing to them, followed by having a dedicated household outlet for EV charging.\n\n\nWhile there is broad consensus between multifamily housing landlords and tenants on household outlets and L2 chargers, many landlords say they’re likely to install L2 charging with power', ' sharing (i.e., if multiple EVs are plugged in, then the charge rate is dynamically lowered). Tenants, however, find this charging style the least appealing. This may present a problem if tenants find power sharing untenable when owning an EV.\n\n\nTwo Important Lessons on EV Charging Infrastructure for Multifamily Housing EV Owners\n\n\nBased on these findings, solving charging for multifamily housing EV owners is not the barrier that many stakeholders believe it is.\n\n\nHowever, it’s also not a fully solved problem and will require further attention from automakers, utilities and policymakers to ensure that multifamily housing residents can participate in and benefit from the e-mobility transition. In this vein, we can learn two main lessons from these findings:\n\n\nLesson 1:\n Continuing to invest in public infrastructure is essential. But it’s not enough to have the infrastructure in place if it’s not visible. Anyone installing charging infrastructure needs to ensure that it’s placed in a visible location and that it has eye-catching branding—avoid the “beige box!” Public infrastructure gives car buyers, regardless of where they live, confidence that they can get a charge when they need it and may play a crucial role in how multifamily housing residents charge.\n\n\nLesson 2:\n Landlords face a balancing act in installing infrastructure for their residents. Tenants who own an EV want a dedicated place to plug in their vehicle, but provisioning dedicated plugs in large parking lots or garages is expensive and risks incurring significant demand charges from the electric utility. Landlords will need to develop phasing plans that allow them to build infrastructure as EV ownership among their tenants grows organically and these plans should include discussion with their utility about ensuring sufficient electric charging capability.\n\n\nFor more details on how multifamily housing residents and their landlords are thinking about EV charging, click below to discover more about our \nEVs for EVeryone\n report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nAbout the EVs for EVeryone Study\n\n\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of 15,553 consumers age 18 to 99 between June 23 and August 24, 2023.

This may present a problem if tenants find power sharing untenable when owning an EV.\n\n\nTwo Important Lessons on EV Charging Infrastructure for Multifamily Housing EV Owners\n\n\nBased on these findings, solving charging for multifamily housing EV owners is not the barrier that many stakeholders believe it is.\n\n\nHowever, it’s also not a fully solved problem and will require further attention from automakers, utilities and policymakers to ensure that multifamily housing residents can participate in and benefit from the e-mobility transition. In this vein, we can learn two main lessons from these findings:\n\n\nLesson 1:\n Continuing to invest in public infrastructure is essential. But it’s not enough to have the infrastructure in place if it’s not visible. Anyone installing charging infrastructure needs to ensure that it’s placed in a visible location and that it has eye-catching branding—avoid the “beige box!” Public infrastructure gives car buyers, regardless of where they live, confidence that they can get a charge when they need it and may play a crucial role in how multifamily housing residents charge.\n\n\nLesson 2:\n Landlords face a balancing act in installing infrastructure for their residents. Tenants who own an EV want a dedicated place to plug in their vehicle, but provisioning dedicated plugs in large parking lots or garages is expensive and risks incurring significant demand charges from the electric utility. Landlords will need to develop phasing plans that allow them to build infrastructure as EV ownership among their tenants grows organically and these plans should include discussion with their utility about ensuring sufficient electric charging capability.\n\n\nFor more details on how multifamily housing residents and their landlords are thinking about EV charging, click below to discover more about our \nEVs for EVeryone\n report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nAbout the EVs for EVeryone Study\n\n\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of 15,553 consumers age 18 to 99 between June 23 and August 24, 2023. Respondents were recruited from multiple opt-in online panels of US adults and were interviewed online. The data were weighted by age, gender, race and household income to match the demographics of the US adult population. Any reported margins of error or significance tests are estimated and rely on the same statistical assumptions as data collected from a random probability sample. Escalent will supply the exact wording of any survey question upon request.', 'In our discussions with electric vehicle (EV) stakeholders, including automakers, utilities and policymakers, we often hear concerns about how people who live in multifamily housing (i.e., apartments and condominiums) can charge their EVs and whether that presents a barrier to adoption.\n\n\nOur recent \nEVs for EVeryone\n study found that, nationally, approximately 25% of car buyers live in multifamily housing. However, that national figure disguises areas where multifamily housing is much more prevalent. For example, 39% of respondents in Cook County, Illinois (i.e., Chicago area), and 52% of respondents in New York City live in multifamily housing.\n\n\nParity in EV Charging Infrastructure Availability?\n\n\nOur \nEVForward™ study of the next generation of EV buyers\n has shown how important home charging is to the EV experience—existing EV owners charge at home more than 80% of the time, while EV Intenders anticipate doing 75% of their charging at home. Single-family homeowners’ parking characteristics are well-suited for charging at home—82% park in their garage or driveway and 48% have access to a standard electrical outlet near where they park.\n\n\nMultifamily housing residents’ parking characteristics are markedly different, with parking lot/garage and on-street parking much more the norm:\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to not having driveway or garage parking, more than half of apartment dwellers and one-third of condo dwellers do not have a dedicated parking spot for themselves. Compounding this, only 30% of condo dwellers and 15% of apartment dwellers have access to a standard electrical outlet near where they park.\n\n\nAccess to standard household outlets is problematic for multifamily housing charging, as these outlets only provide roughly three miles of range per hour of charging, which inadequately covers many drivers’ daily driving habits. However, the picture looks better for people who live in multifamily housing when considering access to Level 2 (L2) charging (which provides around 30 miles of range per hour of charging). Approximately 15% of all car buyers report access to L2 charging regardless of where they live. Additionally, apartment and condo dwellers are twice as likely as single-family housing dwellers to have a DC fast charger (which can add upward of 400 miles of range in an hour) available where they park.\n\n\nAs another charging option, 15% of multifamily housing residents say they could walk to and from a location with a household outlet to charge their vehicle and 13% have a Level 2 charger within walking distance. These residents indicate a strong willingness to do this, with a majority (65%) saying they would likely charge someplace within walking distance to their home. However, 43% of multifamily housing residents report they don’t have any electricity charging source within walking distance.\n\n\nThe Impact of EV Charging Infrastructure on EV Ownership and Intent\n\n\nWhile many EV stakeholders believe that multifamily housing residents aren’t currently buying EVs, and thus solving multifamily housing charging is a future issue, we found that people who live in single-family homes, apartments and condos are equally likely to own an EV or plug-in hybrid. Clearly, any challenges multifamily housing residents have with charging an EV are not insurmountable barriers.\n\n\nThere is a strong correlation between noticing charging infrastructure day-to-day and the perceived practicality of owning an EV. Multifamily housing dwellers are more likely than their counterparts in single-family homes to notice charging infrastructure and/or signage.\n\n\n\n\nThis is reflected in perceived EV practicality: overall, apartment and condo dwellers rate EV practicality at 44 on a 0-to-100 scale, while single-family housing dwellers score EV practicality at 42. The likelihood of considering an EV is similarly higher among multifamily housing dwellers than it is among dwellers of single-family homes.\n\n\nA Disconnect Between Landlords and Tenants on EV Charging?\n\n\nWe found that more than half of multifamily housing landlords will likely install EV charging at their properties in the next three years. However, there’s no clear alignment around how they anticipate providing charging—landlords are as likely to install standard household outlets for EV charging as they are to install dedicated full-power L2 chargers.\n\n\nOne-third of multifamily housing residents say the availability of EV charging will be important in choosing where to live when they next move. However, EV charging availability becomes vastly more important for car buyers who say their next vehicle will be an EV, with 77% saying it will be important in their housing choice. These residents say that a dedicated L2 charger for every EV is most appealing to them, followed by having a dedicated household outlet for EV charging.\n\n\nWhile there is broad consensus between multifamily housing landlords and tenants on household outlets and L2 chargers, many landlords say they’re likely to install L2 charging with power']","Landlords face a balancing act in installing infrastructure for their residents.

One such challenge is the discrepancy between the types of chargers landlords are likely to install and those that tenants find most appealing. While landlords are as likely to install standard household outlets as they are to install full-power L2 chargers, their tenants, especially those who own an EV, prefer having a dedicated L2 charger for every EV. 

Moreover, many landlords consider installing L2 charging with power sharing, whereby if multiple EVs are plugged in, the charge rate is dynamically lowered. However, this charging style is reportedly the least appealing for tenants. This could become an issue if tenants find this power sharing arrangement untenable when owning an EV.

In terms of balancing the needs of EV-owning tenants with the costs and demand charges of installing dedicated charging stations, there are a couple of approaches. Firstly, landlords need to develop phasing plans to gradually build infrastructure as EV ownership among their tenants naturally increases. These plans should include discussions with their utility company to ensure sufficient electric charging capability. 

Secondly, continued investment in public infrastructure is critical. Public infrastructure can give car buyers confidence that they can get a charge when they need it, regardless of where they live. Hence, it might play a vital role in how multifamily housing residents charge their EVs. This could lessen the pressure on landlords to urgently provide comprehensive charging solutions and provide them with more time to install the infrastructure in a cost-effective manner.","['landlords', 'face', 'a', 'balancing', 'act', 'in', 'installing', 'infrastructure', 'for', 'their', 'residents', '.', 'tenants', 'who', 'own', 'an', 'ev', 'want', 'a', 'dedicated', 'place', 'to', 'plug', 'in', 'their', 'vehicle', ',', 'but', 'provisioning', 'dedicated', 'plugs', 'in', 'large', 'parking', 'lots', 'or', 'garages', 'is', 'expensive', 'and', 'risks', 'incurring', 'significant', 'demand', 'charges', 'from', 'the', 'electric', 'utility', '.']","['landlords', 'of', 'multifamily', 'housing', 'face', 'certain', 'challenges', 'when', 'providing', 'ev', 'charging', 'infrastructure', 'for', 'their', 'tenants', '.', 'one', 'such', 'challenge', 'is', 'the', 'discrepancy', 'between', 'the', 'types', 'of', 'chargers', 'landlords', 'are', 'likely', 'to', 'install', 'and', 'those', 'that', 'tenants', 'find', 'most', 'appealing', '.', 'while', 'landlords', 'are', 'as', 'likely', 'to', 'install', 'standard', 'household', 'outlets', 'as', 'they', 'are', 'to', 'install', 'full-power', 'l2', 'chargers', ',', 'their', 'tenants', ',', 'especially', 'those', 'who', 'own', 'an', 'ev', ',', 'prefer', 'having', 'a', 'dedicated', 'l2', 'charger', 'for', 'every', 'ev', '.', 'moreover', ',', 'many', 'landlords', 'consider', 'installing', 'l2', 'charging', 'with', 'power', 'sharing', ',', 'whereby', 'if', 'multiple', 'evs', 'are', 'plugged', 'in', ',', 'the', 'charge', 'rate', 'is', 'dynamically', 'lowered', '.', 'however', ',', 'this', 'charging', 'style', 'is', 'reportedly', 'the', 'least', 'appealing', 'for', 'tenants', '.', 'this', 'could', 'become', 'an', 'issue', 'if', 'tenants', 'find', 'this', 'power', 'sharing', 'arrangement', 'untenable', 'when', 'owning', 'an', 'ev', '.', 'in', 'terms', 'of', 'balancing', 'the', 'needs', 'of', 'ev-owning', 'tenants', 'with', 'the', 'costs', 'and', 'demand', 'charges', 'of', 'installing', 'dedicated', 'charging', 'stations', ',', 'there', 'are', 'a', 'couple', 'of', 'approaches', '.', 'firstly', ',', 'landlords', 'need', 'to', 'develop', 'phasing', 'plans', 'to', 'gradually', 'build', 'infrastructure', 'as', 'ev', 'ownership', 'among', 'their', 'tenants', 'naturally', 'increases', '.', 'these', 'plans', 'should', 'include', 'discussions', 'with', 'their', 'utility', 'company', 'to', 'ensure', 'sufficient', 'electric', 'charging', 'capability', '.', 'secondly', ',', 'continued', 'investment', 'in', 'public', 'infrastructure', 'is', 'critical', '.', 'public', 'infrastructure', 'can', 'give', 'car', 'buyers', 'confidence', 'that', 'they', 'can', 'get', 'a', 'charge', 'when', 'they', 'need', 'it', ',', 'regardless', 'of', 'where', 'they', 'live', '.', 'hence', ',', 'it', 'might', 'play', 'a', 'vital', 'role', 'in', 'how', 'multifamily', 'housing', 'residents', 'charge', 'their', 'evs', '.', 'this', 'could', 'lessen', 'the', 'pressure', 'on', 'landlords', 'to', 'urgently', 'provide', 'comprehensive', 'charging', 'solutions', 'and', 'provide', 'them', 'with', 'more', 'time', 'to', 'install', 'the', 'infrastructure', 'in', 'a', 'cost-effective', 'manner', '.']",0.0182164598386262,0.2222222188797061,0.83840346,0.88172054,0.85951656,"Automotive dealers can use maintenance and repair to increase vehicle life spans and improve customer relationships by offering services that are focused not just on preventing damage but also on extending the life of the vehicle. This can be achieved through services such as predictive maintenance, where potential issues are caught and fixed before they can turn into major problems. Doing this can help reduce the overall cost of vehicle ownership for the customer, which can be particularly beneficial in times of financial uncertainty.

Additionally, dealers can improve their relationships with customers by offering tailored recommendations for maintenance and repair based on the age and condition of the vehicle. This shows the customer that the dealer is truly invested in helping them get the most out of their vehicle, which can lead to greater trust and loyalty.

Finally, dealers can explore alternative business models like car sharing or car subscriptions as added options for customers who may not be in a position to invest in extensive repairs.

Why is considering customers' emotions during a merger or acquisition important for brand-customer relationships and competitive advantage in a relationship economy?,"['Last year was a big year for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and according to \nDeloitte\n, the value of these deals is expected to increase from 38% in 2018 to 51% by the close of 2019. Why? Tax reforms that provide corporations and private equity firms with additional funding are a driving factor behind this flurry of M&A activity. While companies merge for many reasons, the need to \nexpand the customer base in existing geographic\n \nmarkets\n remains a consistent top reason to merge with or acquire another company. \nWhy, then, do so many companies lose track of the customer experience during the transition?\n\n\nThe \ntelecom industry\n experiences an extraordinary amount of merger activity, so Escalent took a look at the experience and the impact on customers. Our study uncovered a gap between customer expectations and company communication during the merger process. This lack of communication often generates anxiety among the customer base. However, \nif a company can bridge customer expectations and communication, there are opportunities to engage a new set of customers while reinvigorating loyal customers.\n\n\nExecuting a successful merger is a Herculean task. (\nEscalent understands this firsthand, having just gone through one.\n) It is easy to lose focus on the customer experience when you are juggling legal issues and myriad internal deadlines. However, setting aside resources to prioritize a consistent and transparent customer communication plan before, during and after the merger can help prevent churn and, in some cases, strengthen customer relationships.\n\n\nFindings outlined within the study include:\n\n\n\n\nTwo-thirds (66%) of respondents have strong feelings of curiosity or caution regarding mergers, while just one-quarter feel indifferent toward the process.\n\n\nThe top customer concerns for the result of mergers are \nservice offerings\n and \ncost\n.\n\n\nMost importantly, consumers indicate their desire for \nopen\n, \nhonest\n \ncommunication\n from the merging company regarding the process and outcomes. A communication strategy for customers should:\n\n\n\nExplain the benefits of the merger\n\n\nDescribe how the merger will affect products, services and pricing\n\n\nEducate customer service staff to quickly address customer concerns\n\n\nUse preferred communication channels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nWhen a company announces a merger, customers feel a range of emotions from nervous, apathetic, or indifferent to helpless. Empathizing with your customers’ feelings can actually foster greater loyalty. To craft an impactful, targeted message around your company’s merger, you need to first understand how your customers are different.

"What are the advantages and obstacles to widespread EV adoption, considering factors like range anxiety, charging infrastructure, driving range, charging time, and pricing?","['EV Potential Not Yet Realized\n\n\nAs we look back on the past decade, I think most of us would acknowledge that it has been a period of tremendous business innovation and industry disruption, whether that be Uber and Lyft upending the taxicab industry, Airbnb undercutting the hotel industry, or streaming video services that have caused consumers to abandon cable and satellite services.\n\n\nIn the coming decade, it seems clear that another industry that will undergo tremendous change is the automotive industry. In particular, auto manufacturers have already started to embrace and invest in technology that will profoundly affect the industry, transportation infrastructure and on consumers themselves: electric vehicles (EVs).\n\n\nThe potential benefits of EVs are numerous and important. Given the increasing threats of climate change, EVs represent a critical step in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and in bettering our environment. In addition, EVs will provide consumers with lower operating and maintenance costs as compared to conventional vehicles.\n\n\nAt the same time, the trade-offs and barriers to EV adoption are also significant. Range anxiety (i.e., the worry that an EV won’t travel a sufficient distance on a single charge) has been a consistent concern of consumers since EVs’ inception. Additionally, even with the fastest chargers, charging times far exceed the five minutes it takes to fill up the gas tank of vehicles with internal combustion engines. Furthermore, while the number of public charging stations has increased significantly over time, they are still limited in number and would likely be insufficient to meet any major, short-term spike in EVs on the road.\n\n\nAuto\n manufacturers and \ntech\n firms have been working hard to reduce these barriers. Batteries and electronics design have improved to the point where some of the latest models tout driving ranges of nearly 400 miles. Apps are now available to identify the location and availability of public charging stations. Public fast-charging stations are now able to recharge up to 80% of a vehicle’s battery in 30 minutes, and various organizations are working on initiatives to reduce charging times further.\n\n\nWhile the adoption of EVs has grown over time, \nEV sales in the US still represent less than 2%\n of the total vehicle market. So, with all of these improvements and the environmental and cost benefits of EVs, why haven’t EV sales been booming? In addition, have tech initiatives really overcome the EV barriers they set out to address? I have some opinions based on my own experience.\n\n\nFunctional Benefits Aren’t Always Enough\n\n\nWhen conducting consumer interviews last year on a wide range of topics including the steps that consumers would willingly take to combat climate change, I asked about the appeal of EVs. Most respondents were notably lukewarm to the general category, yet immediately added as an afterthought, “Now Tesla. That’s an EV that I could get excited about!” In probing further, the interest in Tesla wasn’t based so much on its environmental benefits, but rather its sleek, sexy styling and “cool” image. Given that the styling and image are combined with impressive battery \ntechnology\n and a host of tech features, it is little wonder that Tesla has dominated the US EV market.\n\n\nThe Chevy Bolt is the second most popular EV in the US, but still suffered an almost 9% drop in sales this past year. \n\xa0In its marketing materials, Chevy emphasizes the Bolt’s impressive driving range, low cost of ownership, safety and several other features. My middle brother, a proud Chevy Bolt owner, validates that these claims are true, but he also stresses an emotional benefit that Chevy fails to tout: the Bolt \nis fun to drive\n. With much more torque than internal combustion engines, the Bolt (and EVs in general) can accelerate faster, which makes merging with and maneuvering around traffic easier and more enjoyable. Yet, when it comes to marketing, Chevy appears to be promoting the Bolt on its functional and practical merits only rather than including an appeal to any emotional motivators (i.e., being fun to drive).\n\n\nCharging: Not as Simple as it Seems\n\n\nA little over a year ago, my Chevy Bolt-owning brother decided that he wanted to see if we could make the drive from the San Francisco Bay Area to Lake Tahoe. Knowing that the Bolt couldn’t reach the destination on a single charge, my brother’s first task was to figure out where one could find charging stations along the way. So, unlike traveling in a conventional vehicle with easy access to ubiquitous gas stations along the way, it became clear that EV charging would be more challenging because it involves up-front planning (e.g., knowing how far your vehicle can go, where charging stations are located, and being smart about when to stop to recharge).\n\n\nAfter mapping out the trip and checking his charging station app, my brother came up with a plan to drive to a station about halfway to our destination. With our charging', 'The “Automotive Revolution” has arrived – not with a bang, but with silence. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) – with their emission-free, high-torque benefits – have already become ubiquitous on the streets of the world’s largest cities.\n\n\nInjected into the consciousness by Tesla, which made BEVs cool and sporty while boosting their range between charging cycles, BEVs are finding their way into the hands of a growing number of consumers. In 2018, more than \n2.1 million new car buyers\n around the world chose battery power – motivated by energy-consciousness, the cool factor, or simply being the early adopter for new technologies.\n\n\nAt the same time, it’s still unclear who will be the target buyer for the new generation of BEVs. Though actor Tom Hanks once famously and proudly proclaimed that he drives a BEV “to save America,” such altruism is not universal, especially when it comes at a premium.\n\n\nAlso, manufacturers are still rolling out BEVs that are “less than” – forcing compromises that some members of the car-buying public may feel are simply not worth it. Suffice it to say, finding the balance between actual driving needs and current BEV capabilities will be key to widespread adoption of BEVs.\n\n\nAmong the questions that must be answered satisfactorily for the public to broadly accept BEVs into their lives:\n\n\n1. What do I have to do differently to drive a BEV?\n\n\nTesla aside, many of the current generation of BEVs have required compromises that aren’t always palatable to a public that is well served with current products. BEVs tend to have unusual, polarizing styling cues, and are small in stature, compromising passenger and cargo space for the sake of efficiency. Additionally, fully committing to a BEV means that drivers will have to refine their pedal-stomping, race-from-red driving habits to optimize the range on a charge.\n\n\nManufacturers seem to be heeding the public’s desire for BEVs that blend in. Hyundai’s Kona crossover SUV and the remodeled Nissan Leaf have been styled in the ilk of more traditional offerings – and have been met with accolades as a result.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n2. Where do I plug in?\n\n\nToday, there are more than 67,000 charging stations across the United States, with more opening daily. But there are 168,000 gas stations, which means drivers will likely have to cover significant ground to find a place to “charge up.” Though consumers will get the best charge via a dedicated, proprietary charging connection, many of today’s BEVs can be charged in a pinch (albeit slowly) through typical household current.\n\n\nOf course, you \ncan\n install a fast charger in your own garage; the \nnational average cost for installation\n is around $1,200. For many, charging at home is one of the greatest benefits of having a BEV.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n3. How far can I drive on a full charge?\n\n\nThough this has improved significantly, there’s still a way to go. GM’s first fully electrified vehicles, which hit roadways in the early 1990s, needed a charge every 70 to 80 miles – barely enough for the daily in-town grind, and certainly too stingy for road warriors. Today’s mass market BEVs can cover about 200 miles between plug-ins, and some newer products are even promising 400 miles.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n4. I can fill my gas tank in three minutes – why can’t I charge as fast?\n\n\nCharging technologies, though improved, still haven’t leveled the playing field with fossil-fueled counterparts. The typical home charger can only muster a full charge every 6-8 hours; and fast chargers in the wild can cut that to just a couple of hours (Tesla’s Supercharger technology cuts the full-charging time to just 30 minutes). New battery-charging technologies are being tested that will reduce the charging time to 15 minutes, but it’s important to note that both battery and charging infrastructure will have to be modified to deliver the benefits.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n5. Will prices come down?\n\n\nThis is a function of several factors – improved battery technology as well as government rebates and tax credits certainly will help, but consumer adoption will have the biggest downward pressure on price. It’s truly a chicken-and-egg paradigm – volume will ultimately drive discounts. Consider that the major manufacturers are spinning out millions of gas-powered cars each year – if BEV sales comprise only a small percentage of that total, you have to pass along more of the manufacturing and research charges to the consumer.\n\n\nThat said, more than half of US BEV sales in 2018 were racked up by one car']","The advantages of widespread EV adoption include reducing reliance on fossil fuels, bettering the environment, and lower operating and maintenance costs.

Obstacles to EV adoption are varied. One of the key hurdles is ""range anxiety"", where potential users are concerned about how far they can travel on a single charge. As per the context provided, only 8% of EV owners have completely run out of charge. Nonetheless, the fear of running out of power can be a deterrent to potential buyers. 

Another significant obstacle is the availability and reliability of charging infrastructure. Even though home charging is preferred by EV owners, a robust public charging infrastructure is important both for easing range anxiety and facilitating longer trips. While charging infrastructure is improving, there is still a need for more availability, especially in rural and less heavily populated areas. A related challenge is the time it takes to charge an EV, which can significantly exceed the time it takes to refuel a gasoline vehicle, posing issues on longer trips.

Price can also be an obstacle. While the cost of EVs has been decreasing, they can still be more expensive upfront than comparable gasoline vehicles, although this can be offset by lower operating costs over time.

There are also consumer perceptions and a lack of awareness to tackle; consumers may not be aware of the realities of EV ownership, may not understand the technology or may have misconceptions that need to be addressed. For example, there's a stark disparity between the expectations and reality of living with an EV, both in terms of range anxiety and what it's actually like to own and operate these vehicles. 

Finally, charging solutions, their compatibility, and reliability are also important factors for convenience and consumer trust.","['the', 'advantages', 'of', 'widespread', 'ev', 'adoption', 'include', 'reducing', 'reliance', 'on', 'fossil', 'fuels', ',', 'bettering', 'the', 'environment', ',', 'and', 'lower', 'operating', 'and', 'maintenance', 'costs', '.', 'however', ',', 'there', 'are', 'obstacles', 'such', 'as', 'range', 'anxiety', ',', 'limited', 'charging', 'infrastructure', ',', 'longer', 'charging', 'times', 'compared', 'to', 'filling', 'up', 'gas', 'tanks', ',', 'and', 'the', 'need', 'for', 'prices', 'to', 'come', 'down', '.']","['advantages', 'of', 'ev', 'adoption', 'include', 'their', 'contribution', 'to', 'a', 'reduction', 'in', 'climate', 'change', ',', 'decreased', 'reliance', 'on', 'fossil', 'fuels', ',', 'lower', 'maintenance', 'and', 'operating', 'costs', 'compared', 'to', 'traditional', 'internal', 'combustion', 'vehicles', ',', 'and', 'representing', 'a', 'step', 'towards', 'modern', ',', 'sophisticated', 'technology', '.', 'obstacles', 'to', 'ev', 'adoption', 'are', 'varied', '.', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'key', 'hurdles', 'is', '``', 'range', 'anxiety', ""''"", ',', 'where', 'potential', 'users', 'are', 'concerned', 'about', 'how', 'far', 'they', 'can', 'travel', 'on', 'a', 'single', 'charge', '.', 'as', 'per', 'the', 'context', 'provided', ',', 'only', '8', '%', 'of', 'ev', 'owners', 'have', 'completely', 'run', 'out', 'of', 'charge', '.', 'nonetheless', ',', 'the', 'fear', 'of', 'running', 'out', 'of', 'power', 'can', 'be', 'a', 'deterrent', 'to', 'potential', 'buyers', '.', 'another', 'significant', 'obstacle', 'is', 'the', 'availability', 'and', 'reliability', 'of', 'charging', 'infrastructure', '.', 'even', 'though', 'home', 'charging', 'is', 'preferred', 'by', 'ev', 'owners', ',', 'a', 'robust', 'public', 'charging', 'infrastructure', 'is', 'important', 'both', 'for', 'easing', 'range', 'anxiety', 'and', 'facilitating', 'longer', 'trips', '.', 'while', 'charging', 'infrastructure', 'is', 'improving', ',', 'there', 'is', 'still', 'a', 'need', 'for', 'more', 'availability', ',', 'especially', 'in', 'rural', 'and', 'less', 'heavily', 'populated', 'areas', '.', 'a', 'related', 'challenge', 'is', 'the', 'time', 'it', 'takes', 'to', 'charge', 'an', 'ev', ',', 'which', 'can', 'significantly', 'exceed', 'the', 'time', 'it', 'takes', 'to', 'refuel', 'a', 'gasoline', 'vehicle', ',', 'posing', 'issues', 'on', 'longer', 'trips', '.', 'price', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'an', 'obstacle', '.', 'while', 'the', 'cost', 'of', 'evs', 'has', 'been', 'decreasing', ',', 'they', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'more', 'expensive', 'upfront', 'than', 'comparable', 'gasoline', 'vehicles', ',', 'although', 'this', 'can', 'be', 'offset', 'by', 'lower', 'operating', 'costs', 'over', 'time', '.', 'there', 'are', 'also', 'consumer', 'perceptions', 'and', 'a', 'lack', 'of', 'awareness', 'to', 'tackle', ';', 'consumers', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'of', 'the', 'realities', 'of', 'ev', 'ownership', ',', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'the', 'technology', 'or', 'may', 'have', 'misconceptions', 'that', 'need', 'to', 'be', 'addressed', '.', 'for', 'example', ',', 'there', ""'s"", 'a', 'stark', 'disparity', 'between', 'the', 'expectations', 'and', 'reality', 'of', 'living', 'with', 'an', 'ev', ',', 'both', 'in', 'terms', 'of', 'range', 'anxiety', 'and', 'what', 'it', ""'s"", 'actually', 'like', 'to', 'own', 'and', 'operate', 'these', 'vehicles', '.', 'finally', ',', 'charging', 'solutions', ',', 'their', 'compatibility', ',', 'and', 'reliability', 'are', 'also', 'important', 'factors', 'for', 'convenience', 'and', 'consumer', 'trust', '.']",0.0248558074483985,0.1754385933764235,0.83365387,0.90511465,0.86791575,"The text suggests several methods to reduce video conferencing fatigue and enhance its effectiveness:

1. Use Sparingly: Always consider the necessity of a video component before scheduling a conference. It might make more sense to have a phone call or an email for certain topics, especially when the information is detail-heavy or if the meeting is too large.

2. Go for Brevity: If it's unavoidable, you can try reducing the duration of the video call. Scheduling a shorter meeting and ending it a little early would provide everyone a break before moving on to their next task or another meeting.

3. Reduce Distractions: Limit the ""noise,"" or external distractions that might affect your concentration during the call. This includes turning off unnecessary internet tabs, instant messenger, and self-view camera. If possible, select a clean, uncluttered background and mute your audio when you're not speaking.

4. Prepare in Advance: Prepare an agenda outlining who should speak on each point to avoid confusion and ensure everyone gets a chance to contribute. This structure might feel a bit unusual but it can help prevent important information from being overlooked.

What effects do ridesharing services have on vehicle sales and automotive brand perceptions?,"['It’s safe to say that ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft are an integral part of the automotive and mobility landscape as the global rideshare industry is projected to grow from $51B in 2017 to over $220B by 2025. Ridesharing has become a reliable and relatively safe option for out-of-town business and vacation travel, getting around locally, or simply when in a pinch. A growing number of consumers, especially in urban markets, are even opting to forego private vehicle ownership altogether given the convenience of summoning a rideshare service with the push of a button on a phone app. The appeal of no parking, insurance, fuel, maintenance and, of course, personal responsibility has won over many, even if the collective economics and other conveniences aren’t in favor of ridesharing when traveling a significant number of miles each year.\n\n\nBased on our June-July 2019 Escalent Automotive Consumer Pulse Study, an online survey* conducted monthly among approximately 1,000 US adults 18 years of age and older, one-third of the US adult population are already using rideshare services to varying degrees. Nearly half of these riders have an experience with a rideshare provider at least monthly, which translates to a significant cross-section of exposure to automotive brands. But do these rides have an impact on how consumers perceive automotive brands? Or, perhaps better asked, CAN these rides have an impact on automotive brand perceptions?\n\n\n\n\nRidesharing to Increase Vehicle Sales\n\n\nThere’s plenty of debate around predictions of the impact of ridesharing on new vehicle sales. While an increasing number of consumers may avoid car ownership, the \noverall vehicle-miles traveled will likely not decline\n and are projected to potentially increase as new audiences–such as elderly or disabled people–have growing access to this game-changing mobility option. Therefore, given the faster rate at which miles accumulate, we expect that rideshare vehicle replacement will be on a shorter time cycle than privately-owned vehicles. The need or desire for new technology and vehicle features may also trigger rideshare vehicle owners to purchase new cars sooner, in order to avoid varying degrees of vehicle obsolescence. Rideshare volume (miles driven) is also taking away from traditional mass transit options (such as subway, bus, shuttle, light rail) and, of course, has significantly up-ended the taxi and rental car industry–all supporting the potential for increased vehicle sales.\n\n\nBranding Opportunities with Rideshare Riders\n\n\nWhile the potential for increased new car sales due to ridesharing sounds like a windfall for OEMs, the \nrole of the brand\n itself has the potential to be diluted and considered a commodity to end users of ridesharing services, especially since riders don’t typically have a choice of brand. We dug into this in our study and asked participants about the importance of various aspects of ridesharing. It turns out that the “brand” of rideshare vehicle falls low on the importance continuum for riders when asked how important which brand or model of vehicle picks them up, so long as it is on time and meets their size needs. More than 3 out of 5 people indicated they have no preference at all which brand of vehicle they ride in.\n\n\n\n\nThis may seem like counterbalancing bad news for carmakers. However, this can also be interpreted as an opportunity for automotive manufacturers to create a brand impression and experience with as much as one third of the population. This is a significant, captive audience to engage as future prospects and brand advocates, albeit predominantly from the back seat. Rideshare users represent a sizable and growing target audience that marketers should be clamoring to engage using both subtle and overt cues–particularly in models that lend themselves to rideshare usage.\n\n\nRideshare Branding Recommendations\n\n\nRiders, of course, will have preoccupations during their ride other than observing the vehicle they’re in. However, OEMs have the opportunity to help riders take notice of the vehicle they are riding in, and create or change their brand perceptions. Delivering or conveying the highest order needs, such as safety, quality, harmony, and comfort (seat comfort, ride comfort, legroom, comfort of entry, noise, and climate) will leave riders feeling that the vehicle brand can be trusted and is a leader – and may even pleasantly surprise riders. Providing personalization, such as individual climate control, infotainment options, and other connected features, signals a brand that delivers more than expected. Perhaps the most overlooked opportunity is the presence of branding itself with placement of brand logos and naming to reinforce which brand of vehicle riders are experiencing. Having rideshare drivers who are advocates for the vehicle brand would be an added bonus, and might be had for little or no additional cost.\n\n\nAdmittedly, investing in rear seat appointments runs counterintuitive with typical vehicle usage patterns for some classes of privately-owned vehicles; but the stakes are high']","Ridesharing services have the potential to increase vehicle sales due to the shorter time cycle for rideshare vehicle replacement and the desire for new technology and vehicle features.

"How can automotive dealers use maintenance and repair to increase vehicle life spans and improve customer relationships, given financial concerns and rising vehicle costs?","['With the improved quality of vehicles, technological advancements in automotive component systems, as well as smart manufacturing and better vehicle diagnostics we have seen over the past two decades, it is unsurprising that the average age of a passenger car in 2022 is \n13.1 years\n—four years older than in 2000. The average age of a light-duty truck is also up by three years, averaging \n11.6 years\n in operation.\n\n\nBased on an ongoing Escalent study exploring attitudes and behaviors of vehicle owners and intenders, there are several indicators that the upward trajectory in vehicle age may continue. This suggests there is significant potential for automotive dealers to lean into maintenance and repair offerings that can extend vehicle life spans, thereby further building a positive vehicle ownership experience and relationship with customers.\n\n\nFour Key Factors Driving Vehicle Age\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing Concern About Financial Future:\n According to our study, more than half of consumers are less optimistic about the direction the United States is heading compared to a year ago, which is up from about one-third in 2019. Furthermore, more than one-quarter are less confident in maintaining their household income also compared to a year ago—up from 13% in 2019.\n\n\nRising Vehicle Costs:\n One-third of consumers who do not plan to acquire a vehicle in the next 12 months say they cannot afford to acquire a vehicle right now, and another one in seven says interest rates are too high. Meanwhile, new and used car prices are at record highs. Given the \naverage sale price for a new car in December 2022\n was $49,507—an almost 5% increase from the previous year—and the \naverage used vehicle listing price\n was $26,213 in March 2023, it is understandable that some consumers are not in a position to make such an investment in the short term. Furthermore, nearly two in ten survey respondents state that investing in a new vehicle is a poor value for the money right now.\n\n\nChanging Vehicle Acquisition Plans:\n With record-high transaction prices and an uncertain economy, almost three in ten vehicle intenders are postponing or abandoning their plans to acquire a vehicle.\n\n\nMaintaining Current Vehicles:\n Instead of trading up, drivers are seeking ways to keep their vehicles on the road. Almost four in ten owners of a 2013 or older vehicle prefer to keep their older-model vehicle. The majority of these owners find automotive parts and accessories an easy and affordable way to keep their vehicle feeling new, increase the resale value and enhance safety—thus prolonging the viability of the vehicle and keeping it in operation longer.\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity for Dealers to Strengthen Customer Relationships\n\n\nAlthough car sales may be slowing, this constellation of factors presents a tremendous opportunity for dealers to further strengthen the relationship with their customers and sustain a positive vehicle ownership experience by leveraging the service department as a relevant and frequent touch point.\n\n\nService departments, traditionally, have not taken the lead with marketing and customer retention efforts. However, customers with a decade-plus aged vehicle will appreciate the proactive stance and commitment by dealers to help them preserve a vital asset, especially during volatile economic times.\n\n\nThe vehicle aging trend also presents an opportunity for dealers to explore emerging business models such as car sharing and car subscriptions. These alternatives to vehicle ownership may be a perfect fit for a customer who has an older vehicle where investing in repairs no longer makes good financial sense. These new business models also offer a recurring revenue stream for the dealer, which can be a strong motivating factor for adoption.\n\n\nSupporting Vehicle Owners and Nurturing Brand Loyalty\n\n\nA lot has changed in the industry since 2000 when the average age of a vehicle was nine years and customer expectations were much more manageable.\n\n\nIt is important for dealers to review customer engagement strategies targeted at older-vehicle owners to ensure messaging encompasses a transition from solely preventative maintenance to maintenance and repair-or-replace. By doing so, dealerships can continue nurturing a positive relationship with owners of older vehicles and strengthen brand loyalty.\n\n\nTo learn more about our findings or how we can help you best meet consumers’ needs, click the button below to send us a note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Study\n\n\nEscalent interviewed a national sample of 1,020 consumers ages 18 and older from March 2, 2023 to March 24, 2023. Respondents were recruited from various opt-in online panels of US adults and were interviewed online. Demographic quotas of age, gender, ethnicity, and income were in place to represent the US adult population.

This can be achieved through services such as predictive maintenance, where potential issues are caught and fixed before they can turn into major problems. Doing this can help reduce the overall cost of vehicle ownership for the customer, which can be particularly beneficial in times of financial uncertainty.

Additionally, dealers can improve their relationships with customers by offering tailored recommendations for maintenance and repair based on the age and condition of the vehicle. This shows the customer that the dealer is truly invested in helping them get the most out of their vehicle, which can lead to greater trust and loyalty.

Finally, dealers can explore alternative business models like car sharing or car subscriptions as added options for customers who may not be in a position to invest in extensive repairs.

How can the 6-D Model inform the creation of localized experiences for global customers in cross-cultural research?,"['Cross-cultural research should be a key ingredient in your \nuser experience\n, \ncustomer experience\n, and \nglobal messaging\n research plans. A cross-cultural framework, especially when applied early to your strategy and development, can help you connect with global customers on their terms. In this article, I’ll show how to leverage a framework known as the 6-D Model to create localized experiences for your customers. By way of example, I look at why Japanese websites differ in design and user experience from the same sites created for Western users.\n\n\nUsing Cross-Cultural Research in UX Research & Messaging\n\n\nCultures are different. It makes sense that user preferences differ too. Localizing the customer experience requires a nuanced understanding of how people interpret your message, how they process information, and the types of experiences they value. Cross-cultural research is key to creative and experiential localization. It is not language-based and doesn’t simply strive for accurate and culturally attuned translations. Rather, cross-cultural research looks at how values, beliefs, and behaviors underpin what kinds of messages and user experiences drive desired actions.\n\n\nOne framework that’s used by researchers, including those specializing in user experience research, customer experience research, and ethnography, is Geert Hofstede’s theory of cultural dimensions, also known as the 6-D Model. There’s a lot to this theory that we don’t need to unpack here, but here’s a quick overview.\n\n\nHofstede was a social psychologist who looked at the effects of culture—both the culture of nations and the culture of organizations—on the preferences of its members. He and his research team developed a sociological survey to measure the preference of one state of being over another and used the data to distinguish national preferences on a 0 to 100 scale. He drew up indices reflecting national cultural characteristics of a country, which he called ‘cultural dimensions’.\n\n\nCross-Cultural Research & The 6-D Model\n\n\nThere were originally four and now six cultural dimensions, hence the 6-D Model. Each dimension indicates the degree to which a country:\n\n\n\n\nIs more or less hierarchical\n\n\nPrioritizes the individual or the collective\n\n\nPrioritizes ‘masculine’ values or ‘feminine’ values (We are not fans of the gender stereotypes associated with this metric)\n\n\nIs more or less risk-averse\n\n\nPreserves tradition or seeks change\n\n\nRestrains gratification or indulges it\n\n\n\n\nHere’s more on how these dimensions are defined and measured:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy way of illustration, take a look at Denmark and Sweden.\n\n\n\n\nSource: \nhofstede-insights.com\n\n\nThese countries rate similarly across the 6-D board. Now, ask a Swede or a Dane, and each would invariably provide you with a host of differences between their respective countries. And they’d be justified in doing so. The 6-D Model is not a substitute for deep dives into nuanced cultural distinctions. But what cultural dimensions scores can tell you is that relative to each other, these countries are close in most of their preferences for one state of being over another.\n\n\nYou could note that Swedes, generally, maybe more risk-averse than Danes. Though compared to Germany, which scores 83 on Long Term Orientation, Sweden would look like a land of risk-takers. The important thing to remember about the 6-D model and country comparisons is that they are just that, comparisons. Scores are relative differentiators, not judgments.\n\n\nIn contrast, take a look at Japan and the United States. There are some dramatic differences between how these two countries compare on the six cultural dimensions.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how these differences manifest in terms of needs, what types of messages resonate, and how people want to receive information about your brand is the essential work of user experience research, customer experience research, messaging research, and global consumer insights in general.\n\n\nCombining Cross-Cultural Research with Customer & User Research to Create Localized Experiences\n\n\nCulturally attuned UX research provides a useful baseline understanding of customer preferences, especially in the Discovery phase of research and development. The 6-D Model can be a useful lens for understanding how and why customer experience and design preferences are different across cultures. Whether it is a user interface, an in-store experience, or a visual design, our cultural biases inform how we process information and interact with it.\n\n\nKnowing early on what those cultural predispositions are and how to leverage them is a key factor in the early stages of product development, customer experience, interaction design, product marketing, global campaign strategy, etc.\n\n\nWhich brings us (naturally?) to Japanese websites. To the Western brain, Japanese websites are confusing (and this isn’t']","The 6-D Model can inform the creation of localized experiences for global customers in cross-cultural research by providing a lens for understanding how and why customer experience and design preferences differ across cultures. It helps in identifying cultural predispositions early on in product development, customer experience, interaction design, and global campaign strategy.",multi_context,"[{'title': 'Add Cross-Cultural Research to User Experience Research & Connect with Global Consumers', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/add-cross-cultural-research-to-user-experience-research-connect-with-global-consumers/'}]",True,"The 6-D Model can inform the creation of localized experiences for global customers through its breakdown of the cultural preferences of a country along six dimensions: hierarchy, individualism or collectivism, 'masculine' or 'feminine' values, risk aversion, tradition versus change, and restraint versus indulgence. This model helps to understand how values, beliefs, and behaviors impact customer preferences and inform messaging and user experiences across different cultures. For instance, it can explain why Japanese websites, designed for risk-averse users desiring exhaustive information for making informed decisions, may differ significantly in design from websites aimed at Western users who might be more comfortable with uncertainty. 

It's important to note that the model does not provide absolute judgments and should be viewed as the means for comparative understanding of cultural preferences. Its application can aid the early stages of product development, customer experience, interaction design, and global campaign strategy, helping to localize customer experiences based on the cultural predispositions of different markets. Therefore, cross-cultural research using the 6-D Model can significantly help in effectively communicating and connecting with global customers.","['the', '6-d', 'model', 'can', 'inform', 'the', 'creation', 'of', 'localized', 'experiences', 'for', 'global', 'customers', 'in', 'cross-cultural', 'research', 'by', 'providing', 'a', 'lens', 'for', 'understanding', 'how', 'and', 'why', 'customer', 'experience', 'and', 'design', 'preferences', 'differ', 'across', 'cultures', '.', 'it', 'helps', 'in', 'identifying', 'cultural', 'predispositions', 'early', 'on', 'in', 'product', 'development', ',', 'customer', 'experience', ',', 'interaction', 'design', ',', 'and', 'global', 'campaign', 'strategy', '.']","['the', '6-d', 'model', 'can', 'inform', 'the', 'creation', 'of', 'localized', 'experiences', 'for', 'global', 'customers', 'through', 'its', 'breakdown', 'of', 'the', 'cultural', 'preferences', 'of', 'a', 'country', 'along', 'six', 'dimensions', ':', 'hierarchy', ',', 'individualism', 'or', 'collectivism', ',', ""'masculine"", ""'"", 'or', ""'feminine"", ""'"", 'values', ',', 'risk', 'aversion', ',', 'tradition', 'versus', 'change', ',', 'and', 'restraint', 'versus', 'indulgence', '.', 'this', 'model', 'helps', 'to', 'understand', 'how', 'values', ',', 'beliefs', ',', 'and', 'behaviors', 'impact', 'customer', 'preferences', 'and', 'inform', 'messaging', 'and', 'user', 'experiences', 'across', 'different', 'cultures', '.', 'for', 'instance', ',', 'it', 'can', 'explain', 'why', 'japanese', 'websites', ',', 'designed', 'for', 'risk-averse', 'users', 'desiring', 'exhaustive', 'information', 'for', 'making', 'informed', 'decisions', ',', 'may', 'differ', 'significantly', 'in', 'design', 'from', 'websites', 'aimed', 'at', 'western', 'users', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'with', 'uncertainty', '.', 'it', ""'s"", 'important', 'to', 'note', 'that', 'the', 'model', 'does', 'not', 'provide', 'absolute', 'judgments', 'and', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'as', 'the', 'means', 'for', 'comparative', 'understanding', 'of', 'cultural', 'preferences', '.', 'its', 'application', 'can', 'aid', 'the', 'early', 'stages', 'of', 'product', 'development', ',', 'customer', 'experience', ',', 'interaction', 'design', ',', 'and', 'global', 'campaign', 'strategy', ',', 'helping', 'to', 'localize', 'customer', 'experiences', 'based', 'on', 'the', 'cultural', 'predispositions', 'of', 'different', 'markets', '.', 'therefore', ',', 'cross-cultural', 'research', 'using', 'the', '6-d', 'model', 'can', 'significantly', 'help', 'in', 'effectively', 'communicating', 'and', 'connecting', 'with', 'global', 'customers', '.']",0.1411266852484261,0.3720930193922391,0.86540264,0.93791217,0.90019965,,,,,,,,,
What evidence-based suggestions can be implemented to reduce video conferencing fatigue and improve the effectiveness of video calls?,"['Hangouts. Houseparty. Zoom. BlueJeans. Teams.\n\n\nIn early February, these were likely unrelated words. Together today, they’ve taken on a whole new meaning. As we begin week 11 of the new normal, brought to us by COVID-19, it’s highly likely you’re among the throngs who have used some form of video conferencing. Whether for work, school or social connection, a record number of individuals have downloaded at least one of these programs over the past two months. I did the math in my own home, where I’m sheltering in place with my spouse and our three young children. Among us all, we average about 16 video conference calls a week.\n\n\nWe’re EXHAUSTED. And I don’t think we’re alone.\n\n\nAt first, video conferencing felt novel and exciting. There were team happy hours, Zoom book club meetings, Houseparty girls’ nights and group FaceTimes with family. But the frustrations quickly followed. In addition to the usual tech issues (internet outages, capped time on meetings, user-error on microphone and camera functions, headphone/device compatibility issues, etc.), I found it difficult to focus, particularly with my kids around. I missed pieces of conversation, and I couldn’t lean over to the colleague next to me to get a recap. I delivered reports but couldn’t read body language to gather whether my audience understood the information. I’d contribute to a conversation only to talk over a friend who was trying to do the same, resulting in the ever-awkward “no, you go—no, you go” exchange.\n\n\nAccording to \nPew Internet Research\n, most of us are longing for the swift return of face-to-face interactions. Sixty-four percent of Americans agree that alternative communication formats help during these times but are no substitutes for in-person contact. But with many organizations recommending employees continue working remotely for the foreseeable future, video conferencing may be here to stay. So, how can we improve our circumstances in the here and now? Below, I offer a few evidence-based suggestions for how to use video conferencing to obtain the most benefit and reduce video conferencing fatigue.\n\n\n\n\nUse Sparingly. \nBefore scheduling a video conference, ask yourself: is the video component necessary? How will it enhance the meeting? Perhaps it doesn’t make much sense to have a video conference with a work group of 15+. Nor does it make much sense to use video if all eyes will be focused on the presenter’s PowerPoint slide. For a meeting chock-full of important details you need your team to absorb, would a phone call suffice? Or better yet, an email of those details that team members can reference later when they can give it their full attention?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo for Brevity. \nIf you believe video conferencing is the right choice, consider modifying the allotted time so that your audience, team and/or client has a moment after the call to refocus. For instance, schedule a 30-minute video call but end it after 25 minutes to allow a break for yourself and your team members before they move on to the next item on their to-do list or calendar, which could be—wait for it—another video conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduce Distractions. \nTo ensure effective communication, eliminate as much “noise” as possible. In the communication field, we refer to noise not only as literal sound, but also as any external distraction that impedes our ability to listen. Prior to the video call, close internet tabs or instant messenger. On the actual video platform, consider turning off the self-view camera—so much of our mental fatigue is tied to how \nwe\n look! Speaking of backgrounds, simplify! Don’t get me wrong, I love my \nStar Wars\n-themed picture on Zoom as much as the next gal…but truthfully, busy backgrounds necessitate more mental processing by your audience. Select a background that is clean and free of distractions when possible. Help \nothers \nstay focused by eliminating background noise on your end: mute yourself until it’s your turn to speak (on some platforms, such as Zoom, while muted, you can hold down the space bar to temporarily unmute yourself to briefly speak).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare in Advance. \nFor all the reasons above, participating on a video call can be challenging. The rules of turn-taking falter as we struggle more to read nonverbal cues signaling when someone else wants to speak. Some people (looking at you, introverts) may hesitate or be anxious to share on a video call. And the other half of your audience is likely multitasking anyways. How to beat the odds? Meeting owners should create']","To reduce video conferencing fatigue and improve the effectiveness of video calls, it is suggested to use video conferencing sparingly and consider if the video component is necessary, go for brevity by modifying the allotted time for the call, reduce distractions by eliminating external noise and simplifying backgrounds, and prepare in advance by creating an agenda and encouraging active participation.",multi_context,"[{'title': 'From Fatigued to Fully Functional: Four Tips for Video Conferencing', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/from-fatigued-to-fully-functional-four-tips-for-videoconferencing/'}]",True,"The text suggests several methods to reduce video conferencing fatigue and enhance its effectiveness:

1. Use Sparingly: Always consider the necessity of a video component before scheduling a conference. It might make more sense to have a phone call or an email for certain topics, especially when the information is detail-heavy or if the meeting is too large.

2. Go for Brevity: If it's unavoidable, you can try reducing the duration of the video call. Scheduling a shorter meeting and ending it a little early would provide everyone a break before moving on to their next task or another meeting.

3. Reduce Distractions: Limit the ""noise,"" or external distractions that might affect your concentration during the call. This includes turning off unnecessary internet tabs, instant messenger, and self-view camera. If possible, select a clean, uncluttered background and mute your audio when you're not speaking.

4. Prepare in Advance: Prepare an agenda outlining who should speak on each point to avoid confusion and ensure everyone gets a chance to contribute. This structure might feel a bit unusual but it can help prevent important information from being overlooked.

How has increased battery capacity affected range anxiety and electric vehicle adoption?,"['Since their inception, the biggest concern facing the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has been range capability. To this point, range has been the first drawback on everyone’s mind when it comes to EVs, from early adopters making due with the sub-100 mile ranges of the first available EVs to manufacturers downplaying the anxiety and racing to increase battery capacity.\n\n\nHowever, things are changing. Nearly 20 EVs on the market or available soon will boast ranges of 200 miles or more. While that’s still short of the average gas- or diesel-powered vehicle and such range anxiety won’t just disappear, it’s part of the reason EV-curious shoppers are looking past range to other concerns, like time spent at the charging station.\n\n\nIn fact, consumer focus on fast charging has outpaced concerns over public charger availability, with Time Anxiety™ registering twice as important for an improved EV charging experience as the proximity of a charger to the driver’s route.\n\n\nThose are some of our latest findings at Escalent thanks to a recent \nEVForward™\n DeepDive, which explored the considerations of EV shoppers across the broad adoption spectrum, from early adopters to those most wary and skeptical of the technology. And, it makes sense: an EV with comparable range to a traditional gas-powered vehicle that also requires a lengthy amount of time to refuel—several times longer than a stop at the gas pump—presents many of the same practicality concerns for shoppers as a vehicle with limited range in the first place.\n\n\nSo, while industry players—including manufacturers, regulators and utility companies, among others—are touting new partnerships and rapidly expanding charger networks, they’re not making the dent into the consideration barrier they want to make. Critically, they need to offer expansive charger networks that prioritize fast charging capabilities. Direct current (DC) fast charging is no longer a “nice-to-have” amenity, it’s a critical deal breaker for many consumers. Ultimately, shortening the time spent charging at a station effectively extends the range of the vehicle—at least, in the eyes of those shelling out their hard earned money on a new vehicle.\n\n\nTo learn more about the findings from the latest EVForward™ DeepDive market report, click the button below to watch the 30-minute webinar replay where Automotive & Mobility vice president Mike Dovorany discusses Time Anxiety and several other topics, including the importance of home charging support and the impact of manufacturer warranties for EVs on adoption.']","While increased battery capacity has helped alleviate range anxiety to some extent, it is still a concern for many potential electric vehicle (EV) adopters. The availability of EVs with ranges of 200 miles or more has provided more options for consumers, but it is still shorter than the range of gas- or diesel-powered vehicles. As a result, consumers are now focusing on other concerns, such as time spent at the charging station. Fast charging capabilities have become a critical factor for EV adoption, as it effectively extends the range of the vehicle by shortening the time spent charging.",multi_context,"[{'title': 'As EVs Close the Range Gap, Manufacturers Must Turn Their Attention to Time Spent Charging', 'url': 'https://escalent.co/blog/as-evs-close-the-range-gap-manufacturers-must-turn-their-attention-to-time-spent-charging/'}]",True,"Increased battery capacity in electric vehicles has made a significant impact on range anxiety and EV adoption. With nearly 20 EVs on the market or coming soon featuring ranges of 200 miles or more, the concern about driving range has somewhat diminished.

The longer range is causing prospective buyers to consider other concerns, such as the time spent at charging stations.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EVForward provides insights into the attitudes and behaviors of EV consumers, which can be crucial in understanding and responding to evolving market demands. It has identified six unique European EV buyer personas, understanding of which can assist in tailoring strategies for future EV buyers. Furthermore, four areas have been identified that could ease EV adoption and ownership: the nature of EV journeys, resources for EV charging, EV buyer motivations and the emotional drivers of EV owners. These areas can assist automotive manufacturers to develop effective positioning strategies, enhance user experience and create a reassuring and rewarding environment for potential EV buyers.

Moreover, the survey findings reveal that automakers need to educate potential EV buyers on managing EV journeys, offer support to overcome charging problems, understanding different buyer personas, and ensure the vehicle design reflects the desired role-play signal for the owner. This calls for a multifaceted support framework, suitable for different consumer mindsets across varying circumstances. 

By studying the provided insights and incorporating them into their approach, automakers and EV stakeholders can foster and embolden an ""EV easy"" mindset among consumers, increasing the likelihood of further adoption.",1.0,0.9443756456729036,0.9999999999666668,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.999999999375,0.9161775168375916,0.5504729506379693
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Advantages of EV adoption include their contribution to a reduction in climate change, decreased reliance on fossil fuels, lower maintenance and operating costs compared to traditional internal combustion vehicles, and representing a step towards modern, sophisticated technology. 

Obstacles to EV adoption are varied. One of the key hurdles is ""range anxiety"", where potential users are concerned about how far they can travel on a single charge. As per the context provided, only 8% of EV owners have completely run out of charge. Nonetheless, the fear of running out of power can be a deterrent to potential buyers. 

Another significant obstacle is the availability and reliability of charging infrastructure. Even though home charging is preferred by EV owners, a robust public charging infrastructure is important both for easing range anxiety and facilitating longer trips. While charging infrastructure is improving, there is still a need for more availability, especially in rural and less heavily populated areas. A related challenge is the time it takes to charge an EV, which can significantly exceed the time it takes to refuel a gasoline vehicle, posing issues on longer trips.

Price can also be an obstacle. While the cost of EVs has been decreasing, they can still be more expensive upfront than comparable gasoline vehicles, although this can be offset by lower operating costs over time.

There are also consumer perceptions and a lack of awareness to tackle; consumers may not be aware of the realities of EV ownership, may not understand the technology or may have misconceptions that need to be addressed. For example, there's a stark disparity between the expectations and reality of living with an EV, both in terms of range anxiety and what it's actually like to own and operate these vehicles. 

Finally, charging solutions, their compatibility, and reliability are also important factors for convenience and consumer trust.",1.0,0.9016760356879336,0.99999999995,1.0,1.0,0.9999999988888888,0.9500159532297684,0.6465948973983511
